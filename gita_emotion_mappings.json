According to the standard of the Gita, a learned manis he who sees on equal terms the learned brahmana, the dog, the cow,the elephant and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee.Sri Nityananda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divinemaster, delivered the typical naradhamas, the brothers Jagai andMadhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon thelowest of mankind. So the naradhama who is condemned by the Personalityof Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by themercy of a devotee.Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in propagating the bhagavata-dharma oractivities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissivelyhear the message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of thismessage is Bhagavad-gita. The lowest amongst human beings can bedelivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunatelythey even deny giving an aural reception to these messages, and what tospeak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Naradhamas, orthe lowest of mankind, will fully neglect the prime duty of the humanbeing.(3) The next class of duskrti is called mayayapahrta-jnanah, or thosepersons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence ofillusory material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows--greatphilosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc.--but the illusoryenergy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.There are a great number of mayayapahrta-jnanah at the present moment,even amongst the scholars of the Gita. In the Gita, in plain and simplelanguage, it is stated that Sri Krsna is the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned asthe father of Brahma, the original father of all human beings. In fact,Sri Krsna is said to be not only the father of Brahma but also thefather of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahmanand Paramatma; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. Heis the fountainhead of everything and everyone is advised to surrenderunto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, themayayapahrta-jnanah deride the personality of the Supreme Lord andconsider Him merely another human being. They do not know that theblessed form of human life is designed after the eternal andtranscendental feature of the Supreme Lord.All the unauthorized interpretations of the Gita by the class ofmayayapahrta-jnanah, outside the purview of the parampara system, areso many stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding. Thedeluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna,nor do they teach others to follow this principle.(4) The last class of duskrti is called asuram bhavam asritah, or thoseof demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them\nargue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world,\nbut they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. Thereare others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, althoughthe opposite is declared in the Gita. Envious of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicitincarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such personswhose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godheadcannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna.Sri Yamunacarya Albandaru of South India said, \"O my Lord! You areunknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles, despite Youruncommon qualities, features, and activities and despite Yourpersonality being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in thequality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famousauthorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendentalscience and situated in the godly qualities.\"Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3)the deluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as abovementioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality ofGodhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice.\nTEXT 16\ncatur-vidha bhajante mam\njanah sukrtino 'rjunaarto jijnasur artharthijnani ca bharatarsabha\nSYNONYMScatuh-vidhah--four kinds of; bhajante--render services; mam--unto Me;\njanah--persons; su-krtinah--those who are pious; arjuna--O Arjuna;artah--the distressed; jijnasuh--the inquisitive; artha-arthi--one whodesires material gain; jnani--one who knows things as they are; ca--also; bharata-rsabha--O great one amongst the descendants of Bharata.\nTRANSLATIONO best among the Bharatas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render\ndevotional service unto Me--the distressed, the desirer of wealth, theinquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.\nPURPORTUnlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles\nof the scriptures, and they are called sukrtinah, or those who obey therules and regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, andare, more or less, devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there arefour classes of men--those who are sometimes distressed, those who arein need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those whoare sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Thesepersons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under differentconditions. These are not pure devotees because they have someaspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Puredevotional service is without aspiration and without desire formaterial profit. The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.11) defines puredevotion thus:\nanyabhilasita-sunyam\njnana-karmady-anavrtam\nanukulyena krsnanu-silanam bhaktir uttama\n\"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord\nKrsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain throughfruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called puredevotional service.\"When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord fordevotional service and are completely purified by the association of apure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreantsare concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult becausetheir lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. Buteven some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a puredevotee, also become pure devotees.Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord inmaterial distress and at that time associate with pure devotees andbecome, in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simplyfrustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees andbecome inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dryphilosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimeswant to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to renderdevotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonalBrahman and the localized Paramatma and come to the personal conceptionof Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On thewhole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge,and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires,and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothingto do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long assuch a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendentalservice to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and theysearch after mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all thisbefore one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.\nTEXT 17\ntesam jnani nitya-yukta\neka-bhaktir visisyatepriyo hi jnanino 'tyarthamaham sa ca mama priyah\nSYNONYMStesam--out of them; jnani--one in full knowledge; nitya-yuktah--always\nengaged; eka--only one; bhaktih--in devotional service; visisyate--especially; priyah--very dear; hi--certainly; jnaninah--person inknowledge; atyartham--highly; aham--I am; sah--he; ca--also; mama--Mine; priyah--dear.\nTRANSLATIONOf these, the wise one who is in full knowledge in union with Me\nthrough pure devotional service is the best.

But out of them, he who is in knowledge ofthe Absolute Truth and free from all material desires becomes a reallypure devotee of the Lord. And of the four orders, the devotee who is infull knowledge and is at the same time engaged in devotional serviceis, the Lord says, the best. By searching after knowledge one realizesthat his self is different from his material body, and when furtheradvanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman and Paramatma.When one is fully purified, he realizes that his constitutionalposition is to be the eternal servant of God. So by association withpure devotees, the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker aftermaterial amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselvespure. But in the preparatory stage, the man who is in full knowledge ofthe Supreme Lord and is at the same time executing devotional serviceis very dear to the Lord. He who is situated in pure knowledge of thetranscendence of the Supreme Personality of God is so protected indevotional service that material contamination cannot touch him.\nTEXT 18\nudarah sarva evaite\njnani tv atmaiva me matamasthitah sa hi yuktatmamam evanuttamam gatim\nSYNONYMSudarah--magnanimous; sarve--all; eva--certainly; ete--these; jnani--one\nwho is in knowledge; tu--but; atma eva--just like Myself; me--My;matam--opinion; asthitah--situated; sah--he; hi--certainly; yukta-atma--engaged in devotional service; mam--unto Me; eva--certainly;anuttamam--the highest goal; gatim--destination.\nTRANSLATIONAll these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is\nsituated in knowledge of Me I consider verily to dwell in Me.

The Lord says that all are magnanimous becauseanyone who comes to the Lord for any purpose is called a mahatma orgreat soul. The devotees who want some benefit out of devotionalservice are accepted by the Lord because there is an exchange ofaffection. Out of affection they ask the Lord for some materialbenefit, and when they get it they become so satisfied that they alsoadvance in devotional service. But the devotee in full knowledge isconsidered to be very dear to the Lord because his only purpose is toserve the Supreme Lord with love and devotion. Such a devotee cannotlive a second without contacting or serving the Supreme Lord.Similarly, the Supreme Lord is very fond of His devotee and cannot beseparated from him.In the Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.4.68), the Lord says:\nsadhavo hrdayam mahyam\nsadhunam hrdayam tv aham\nmad-anyat te na janantinaham tebhyo manag api\n\"The devotees are always in My heart, and I am always in the hearts of\nthe devotees. The devotee does not know anything beyond Me, and I alsocannot forget the devotee. There is a very intimate relationshipbetween Me and the pure devotees. Pure devotees in full knowledge arenever out of spiritual touch, and therefore they are very much dear toMe.\"\nTEXT 19\nbahunam janmanam ante\njnanavan mam prapadyatevasudevah sarvam itisa mahatma su-durlabhah\nSYNONYMSbahunam--many; janmanam--births; ante--after; jnana-van--he possessing\nknowledge; mam--unto Me; prapadyate--surrenders; vasudevah--cause ofall causes; sarvam--all; iti--thus; sah--such; maha-atma--great soul;su-durlabhah--very rare.\nTRANSLATIONAfter many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge\nsurrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and allthat is. Such a great soul is very rare.\nPURPORTThe living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental\nrituals after many, many births, may actually become situated intranscendental pure knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godheadis the ultimate goal of spiritual realization. In the beginning ofspiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one's attachmentto materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but whenone is further advanced he can understand that there are activities inthe spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotionalservice. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personalityof Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understandthat Lord Sri Krsna's mercy is everything, that He is the cause of allcauses and that this material manifestation is not independent fromHim. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection ofspiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is arelationship with the Supreme Lord Krsna. Thus he thinks of everythingin relation to Vasudeva, or Sri Krsna. Such a universal vision ofVasudeva precipitates one's full surrender to the Supreme Lord SriKrsna as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter (verses 14 and15) of the Svetasvatara Upanisad: \"In this body there are powers ofspeaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental activities, etc. But theseare not important if not related to the Supreme Lord and becauseVasudeva is all-pervading and everything is Vasudeva, the devoteesurrenders in full knowledge (cf. Bhagavad-gita 7.17 and 11.40).\nTEXT 20\nkamais tais tair hrta-jnanah\nprapadyante 'nya-devatahtam tam niyamam asthayaprakrtya niyatah svaya\nSYNONYMSkamaih--by desires; taih--by those; taih--by those; hrta--distorted;\njnanah--knowledge; prapadyante--surrender; anya--other; devatah--demigods; tam--that; tam--that; niyamam--rules; asthaya--following;prakrtya--by nature; niyatah--controlled; svaya--by their own.\nTRANSLATIONThose whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto\ndemigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worshipaccording to their own natures.\nPURPORTThose who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto the\nSupreme Lord and engage in His devotional service. As long as thematerial contamination is not completely washed off, they are by naturenondevotees. But even those who have material desires and who resort tothe Supreme Lord are not so much attracted by external nature; becauseof approaching the right goal, they soon become free from all materiallust. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is recommended that whether one isfree from all material desires, or is full of material desires, ordesires liberation from material contamination, or is a pure devoteeand has no desire for material sense gratification, he should in allcases surrender to Vasudeva and worship Him.It is said in the Bhagavatam that less intelligent people who have losttheir spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediatefulfillment of material desires. Generally, such people do not go tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in particularmodes of nature (ignorance and passion) and therefore worship variousdemigods. Following the rules and regulations of worship, they aresatisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desiresand do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of theSupreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there arerecommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes(e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who arenot devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods arebetter than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows that the SupremeLord Krsna is the master of all. In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 5.142)it is said, ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya: only the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Krsna, is master, and all others are servants.Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of hismaterial needs. He depends on the Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee issatisfied with whatever He gives.\nTEXT 21\nyo yo yam yam tanum bhaktah\nsraddhayarcitum icchatitasya tasyacalam sraddham\ntam eva vidadhamy aham\nSYNONYMSyah--that; yah--that; yam--which; yam--which; tanum--form of the\ndemigods; bhaktah--devotee; sraddhaya--with faith; arcitum--to worship;icchati--desires; tasya--of that; tasya--of that; acalam--steady;sraddham--faith; tam--him; eva--surely; vidadhami--give; aham--I.\nTRANSLATIONI am in everyone's heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to\nworship the demigods, I make his faith steady so that he can devotehimself to some particular deity.\nPURPORTGod has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires\nto have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have suchfacilities from the material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoulin everyone's heart, understands and gives facilities to such persons.As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interferewith their independence, but gives all facilities so that they canfulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the all-powerful Godgives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this materialworld and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. Theanswer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give suchfacilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore Hegives everyone full independence--whatever one likes--but His ultimateinstruction we find in the Bhagavad-gita: man should give up all otherengagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man happy.Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannotworship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow anybenediction without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade ofgrass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to thedemigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wantingsome particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For example,a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a personwanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvati; and aperson wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Uma, the wifeof Lord Siva. In this way there are recommendations in the sastras(Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of differentdemigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy aparticular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strongdesire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and sohe successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of thedevotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type ofdemigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannotinfuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is theSupreme Lord or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts of allliving entities, Krsna gives impetus to man to worship certaindemigods. The demigods are actually different parts of the universalbody of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence. In theVedic literature it is stated: \"The Supreme Personality of Godhead asSupersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod; therefore Hearranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the living\nentity. But both the demigod and the living entity are dependent on the\nsupreme will. They are not independent.\"\nTEXT 22\nsa taya sraddhaya yuktas\ntasyaradhanam ihatelabhate ca tatah kamanmayaiva vihitan hi tan\nSYNONYMSsah--he; taya--with that; sraddhaya--with faith; yuktah--endowed;\ntasya--his; aradhanam--worship; ihate--seeks; labhate--obtains; ca--and; tatah--from which; kaman--desires; maya--by Me; eva--alone;vihitan--regulated; hi--for; tan--those.\nTRANSLATIONEndowed with such a faith, he seeks favors of a particular demigod and\nobtains his desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Mealone.\nPURPORTThe demigods cannot award benedictions to the devotees without the\npermission of the Supreme Lord. The living entity may forget thateverything is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do notforget. So the worship of demigods and achievement of desired resultsare due not to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,by arrangement. The less intelligent living entity does not know this,and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit. Butthe pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the SupremeLord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a puredevotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is madto fulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired bythe living entity and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. Inthe Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that one who worships the SupremeLord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictoryin his desires. Devotional service of the Supreme Lord and the worshipof a demigod cannot be on the same platform because worship of ademigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord iscompletely spiritual.For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, materialdesires are impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore notawarded the material benefits desired by less intelligent livingentities who prefer to worship demigods of the material world ratherthan engage in devotional service of the Supreme Lord.\nTEXT 23\nantavat tu phalam tesam\ntad bhavaty alpa-medhasamdevan deva-yajo yantimad-bhakta yanti mam api\nSYNONYMS\nanta-vat tu--limited and temporary; phalam--fruits; tesam--their; tat--\nthat; bhavati--becomes; alpa-medhasam--of those of small intelligence;devan--demigods' planets; deva-yajah--worshipers of demigods; yanti--achieve; mat--My; bhaktah--devotees; yanti--attain; mam--to Me; api--surely.\nTRANSLATIONMen of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are\nlimited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planetsof the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.\nPURPORTSome commentators on the Gita say that one who worships a demigod can\nreach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that theworshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems wherevarious demigods are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achievesthe sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon.Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he canattain that particular god's planet. It is not that everyone,regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the SupremePersonality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly statedthat the worshipers of the demigods go to different planets in thematerial world, but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly tothe supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different partsof the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achievedby worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are lessintelligent because they don't know to what part of the body food mustbe supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there aremany parts and many ways to supply food. This isn't very sanguine. Cananyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do notknow that these demigods are different parts of the universal body ofthe Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each andevery demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary livingentities are also. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that thebrahmanas are the head of the Supreme Lord, the ksatriyas are the arms,etc., and that all serve different functions. Regardless of thesituation, if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part andparcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he doesnot understand this, he achieves different planets where the demigodsreside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.The results achieved by the demigods' benedictions are perishablebecause within this material world the planets, the demigods and theirworshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in thisverse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable,and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent livingentity. Because the pure devotee engaged in Krsna consciousness indevotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissfulexistence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of thecommon worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme Lord isunlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Thereforethe mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.\nTEXT 24\navyaktam vyaktim apannam\nmanyante mam abuddhayahparam bhavam ajanantomamavyayam anuttamam\nSYNONYMSavyaktam--nonmanifested; vyaktim--personality; apannam--achieved;\nmanyante--think; mam--unto Me; abuddhayah--less intelligent persons;param--supreme; bhavam--state of being; ajanantah--without knowing;mama--My; avyayam--imperishable; anuttamam--the finest.\nTRANSLATIONUnintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form\nand personality.

Lord Krsna in His personal form is here speaking beforeArjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that theSupreme Lord ultimately has no form. Yamunacarya, a great devotee ofthe Lord in the disciplic succession from Ramanujacarya, has writtentwo very appropriate verses in this connection. He says,\"My dear Lord, devotees like Vyasadeva and Narada know You to be thePersonality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures,one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Youractivities, and one can thus understand that You are the SupremePersonality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion andignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They areunable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be indiscussing Vedanta and the Upanisads and other Vedic literatures, it isnot possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.\"(Stotra-ratna 12)In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the Personality of Godheadcannot be understood simply by study of the Vedanta literature. Only bythe mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme beknown. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only arethe worshipers of the demigods less intelligent, but those nondevoteeswho are engaged in Vedanta and speculation on Vedic literature withoutany tinge of true Krsna consciousness are also less intelligent, andfor them it is not possible to understand God's personal nature.Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth isimpersonal are described as abuddhayah, which means one who does notknow the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from theimpersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul--but theultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead.Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not evenfollow their great predecessor, Sankaracarya, who has specificallystated that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think Krsnato be only the son of Devaki and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerfulliving entity. This is also condemned in the Bhagavad-gita (9.11).\nAvajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam: \"Only the fools regard Me\nas an ordinary person.\"The fact is that no one can understand Krsna without renderingdevotional service and without developing Krsna consciousness. The Gitaconfirms this.One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, or Hisform, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussingVedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. Whenone is fully engaged in Krsna consciousness, beginning by chanting themaha-mantra--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama,Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare--then only can one understand theSupreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think thatKrsna has a body made of this material nature and that all Hisactivities, His form and everything, are maya. These impersonalists areknown as Mayavadis. They do not know the ultimate truth.The twentieth verse clearly states, kamais tais tair hrta-jnanahprapadyante 'nya-devatah. \"Those who are blinded by lusty desiressurrender unto the different demigods.\" It is accepted that besides theSupreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have theirdifferent planets, and the Lord also has a planet. As stated in thetwenty-third verse, devan deva-yajo yanti mad-bhakta yanti mam api: theworshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods,and those who are devotees of Lord Krsna go to the Krsnaloka planet.Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists stillmaintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms areimpositions. From the study of the Gita does it appear that thedemigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigodsnor Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They areall persons; Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Hehas His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless andthat form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here thatit is not imposed. From the Gita we can clearly understand that theforms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord aresimultaneously existing and that Lord Krsna is sac-cid-ananda, eternalblissful knowledge. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme AbsoluteTruth is ananda-mayo, or by nature full of blissful pleasure, and thatHe is abhyasat, by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspiciousqualities. And in the Gita the Lord says that although He is aja(unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we shouldunderstand from the Bhagavad-gita. We cannot understand how the SupremePersonality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of theimpersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the Gita areconcerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, LordKrsna, has both form and personality.\nTEXT 25\nnaham prakasah sarvasya\nyoga-maya-samavrtahmudho 'yam nabhijanatiloko mam ajam avyayam\nSYNONYMSna--nor; aham--I; prakasah--manifest; sarvasya--to everyone; yoga-maya-\n-internal potency; samavrtah--covered; mudhah--foolish; ayam--this; na-\n-not; abhijanati--can understand; lokah--such less intelligent persons;\nmam--Me; ajam--unborn; avyayam--inexhaustible.\nTRANSLATIONI am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent.

Butactually He was not manifest to everyone. When Krsna was present therewere only a few people who could understand Him to be the SupremePersonality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when Sisupala spokeagainst Krsna being elected president of the assembly, Bhisma supportedHim and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the Pandavasand a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He wasnot revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore in theGita Krsna says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him tobe like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as thereservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees,He was covered by His internal potency.In the prayers of Kunti in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.8.19) it is saidthat the Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-maya and thus ordinarypeople cannot understand Him. This yoga-maya curtain is also confirmedin the Isopanisad (mantra 15), in which the devotee prays:\"O my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, anddevotional service to You is the highest religious principle.Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendentalform is covered by the yoga-maya. The brahmajyoti is the covering ofthe internal potency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgencethat impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, Your eternal formof bliss and knowledge.\"This yoga-maya curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter ofthe Gita. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental formof bliss and knowledge is covered by the internal potency of thebrahmajyoti, and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see theSupreme on this account. Also in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.7) thereis this prayer by Brahma: \"O Supreme Personality of Godhead, OSupersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency andpastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your internal potency,and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learnedscholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world oreven the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energyand potency, although You are present before them.\" The SupremePersonality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, is not only unborn but also avyaya,inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and Hisenergies are all inexhaustible.\nTEXT 26\nvedaham samatitani\nvartamanani carjunabhavisyani ca bhutanimam tu veda na kascana\nSYNONYMS\nveda--know; aham--I; sama--equally; a titani--past; vartamanani--\npresent; ca--and; arjuna--O Arjuna; bhavisyani--future; ca--also;bhutani--living entities; mam--Me; tu--but; veda--knows; na--not;kascana--anyone.\nTRANSLATIONO Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that\nhas happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and allthings that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me noone knows.\nPURPORTHere the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated.\nIf Krsna, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is consideredby the impersonalists to be maya, to be material, then He would, likethe living entity, change His body and forget everything in His pastlife. Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, norcan he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of hispresent life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past,present and future. Unless one is liberated from materialcontamination, he cannot know past, present and future.Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord Krsna clearly says that Hecompletely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in thepresent, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter wehave seen that Lord Krsna remembers instructing Vivasvan, the sun-god,millions of years ago. Krsna knows every living entity because He issituated in every living being's heart as the Supreme Soul. But despiteHis presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presencebeyond the material sky, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, theless intelligent cannot realize Him as the Supreme Person. Certainlythe transcendental body of Sri Krsna is not perishable. He is just likethe sun, and maya is like the cloud. In the material world we can seethat there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars andplanets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, butthis covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon andstars are not actually covered. Similarly, maya cannot cover theSupreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the lessintelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of thischapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to becomeperfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousandsof such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord Krsna is.Even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal Brahman orlocalized Paramatma, he cannot possibly understand the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, without being in Krsnaconsciousness.\nTEXT 27\niccha-dvesa-samutthena\ndvandva-mohena bharatasarva-bhutani sammohamsarge yanti parantapa\nSYNONYMS\niccha--desire; dvesa--hate; samutthena--born; dvandva--duality; mohena-\n-overcome; bharata--O scion of Bharata; sarva--all; bhutani--livingentities; sammoham--into delusion; sarge--in creation; yanti--go;parantapa--O conqueror of enemies.\nTRANSLATIONO scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living\nentities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desireand hate.\nPURPORTThe real constitutional position of the living entity is that of\nsubordination to the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one isdeluded into separation from this pure knowledge, he becomes controlledby illusory energy and cannot understand the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. The illusory energy is manifested in the duality of desire andhate. Due to desire and hate, the ignorant person wants to become onewith the Supreme Lord and envies Krsna as the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Pure devotees, who are not so deluded or contaminated bydesire and hate, can understand that Lord Sri Krsna appears by Hisinternal potencies, but those who are deluded by duality and nesciencethink that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is created by materialenergies. This is their misfortune. Such deluded persons,symptomatically, dwell in dualities of dishonor and honor, misery andhappiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure and pain, etc.,thinking, \"This is my wife; this is my house; I am the master of thishouse; I am the husband of this wife.\" These are the dualities ofdelusion. Those who are so deluded by dualities are completely foolishand therefore cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nTEXT 28\nyesam tv anta-gatam papam\njananam punya-karmanamte dvandva-moha-nirmuktabhajante mam drdha-vratah\nSYNONYMSyesam--whose; tu--but; anta-gatam--completely eradicated; papam--sin;\njananam--of the persons; punya--pious; karmanam--previous activities;te--they; dvandva--duality; moha--delusion; nirmuktah--free from;bhajante--worship; mam--Me; drdha-vratah--with determination.\nTRANSLATIONPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life,\nwhose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed fromthe duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service withdetermination.\nPURPORTThose eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are\nmentioned in this verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish\nand deceitful, it is very difficult to transcend the duality of desire\nand hate. Only those who have passed their lives in practicing theregulative principles of religion, who have acted piously and who haveconquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service and graduallyrise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then,gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritualplatform. This elevation is possible in Krsna consciousness in theassociation of pure devotees who can deliver one from delusion.It is stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.2) that if one actuallywants to be liberated he must render service to the devotees (mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh); but one who associates with materialisticpeople is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence (tamo-dvaram yositam sangi-sangam). All the devotees of the Lord traversethis earth just to recover the conditioned souls from their delusion.The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their constitutionalposition as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest violationof God's law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutionalposition, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality orto be fully engaged in His transcendental loving service withdetermination.\nTEXT 29\njara-marana-moksaya\nmam asritya yatanti yete brahma tad viduh krtsnamadhyatmam karma cakhilam\nSYNONYMSjara--old age; marana--death; moksaya--for the purpose of liberation;\nmam--unto Me; asritya--taking shelter of; yatanti--endeavor; ye--allthose; te--such persons; brahma--Brahman; tat--actually that; viduh--they know; krtsnam--everything; adhyatmam--transcendental; karma--fruitive activities; ca--and; akhilam--entirely.\nTRANSLATIONIntelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and\ndeath take refuge in Me in devotional service. They are actuallyBrahman because they entirely know everything about transcendental andfruitive activities.\nPURPORTBirth, death, old age and diseases affect this material body, but not\nthe spiritual body. There is no birth, death, old age and disease forthe spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one ofthe associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages ineternal devotional service, is really liberated. Aham brahmasmi: I amspirit. It is said that one should understand that he is Brahman--spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is also in devotionalservice, as described in this verse. The pure devotees aretranscendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they knoweverything about transcendental and material activities.\nFour kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the\ntranscendental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, andby the grace of the Supreme Lord, when they are fully Krsna conscious,they actually enjoy spiritual association with the Supreme Lord. Butthose who are worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord inHis supreme planet. Even the less intelligent Brahman-realized personscannot reach the supreme planet of Krsna known as Goloka Vrndavana.Only persons who perform activities in Krsna consciousness (mamasritya) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they areactually endeavoring to reach the Krsna planet. Such persons have nomisgivings about Krsna, and thus they are factually Brahman.Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or arca of the Lord, orwho are engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation frommaterial bondage, also know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports ofBrahman, adhibhuta, etc., as explained by the Lord in the next chapter.\nTEXT 30\nsadhibhutadhidaivam mam\nsadhiyajnam ca ye viduhprayana-kale 'pi ca mamte vidur yukta-cetasah\nSYNONYMSsa-adhibhuta--the governing principle of the material manifestation;\nadhidaivam--underlying all the demigods; mam--Me; sa-adhiyajnam--sustaining all sacrifices; ca--and; ye--those; viduh--know; prayana--ofdeath; kale--at the time; api--even; ca--and; mam--Me; te--they; viduh--know; yukta-cetasah--with steadfast minds.\nTRANSLATIONThose who know Me as the Supreme Lord, as the governing principle of\nthe material manifestation, who know Me as the one underlying all thedemigods and as the one sustaining all sacrifices, can, with steadfastmind, understand and know Me, even at the time of death.\nPURPORTPersons acting in Krsna consciousness are never entirely deviated from\nthe path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In thetranscendental association of Krsna consciousness, one can understandhow the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the materialmanifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by suchtranscendental association, one becomes convinced of the SupremePersonality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a Krsnaconscious person can never forget Krsna. Naturally he is thus promotedto the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Vrndavana.This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fullyKrsna conscious person. The beginning of Krsna consciousness isassociation of persons who are in Krsna consciousness. Such associationis spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and,by His grace, one can understand Krsna to be the Supreme God. At thesame time one can really understand the constitutional position of theliving entity and how the living entity forgets Krsna and becomesentangled in material activities. By gradual development of Krsnaconsciousness in good association, the living entity can understand\nthat due to forgetfulness of Krsna he has become conditioned by the\nlaws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form oflife is an opportunity to regain Krsna consciousness and that it shouldbe fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress,the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledgeof Brahman, knowledge of Paramatma, liberation from birth, death anddiseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actuallyelevated in Krsna consciousness does not care for the differentprocesses. He simply directly engages himself in activities of Krsnaconsciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional positionas an eternal servitor of Lord Krsna. In such a situation he takespleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotionalservice. He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will befulfilled. This determined faith is called drdha-vrata, and that is thebeginning of bhakti-yoga or transcendental loving service. That is theverdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the Gita is thesubstance of that conviction.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the\nSrimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute."

According to the standard of the Gita, a learned manis he who sees on equal terms the learned brahmana, the dog, the cow,the elephant and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee.Sri Nityananda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divinemaster, delivered the typical naradhamas, the brothers Jagai andMadhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon thelowest of mankind. So the naradhama who is condemned by the Personalityof Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by themercy of a devotee.Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in propagating the bhagavata-dharma oractivities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissivelyhear the message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of thismessage is Bhagavad-gita. The lowest amongst human beings can bedelivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunatelythey even deny giving an aural reception to these messages, and what tospeak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Naradhamas, orthe lowest of mankind, will fully neglect the prime duty of the humanbeing.(3) The next class of duskrti is called mayayapahrta-jnanah, or thosepersons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence ofillusory material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows--greatphilosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc.--but the illusoryenergy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.There are a great number of mayayapahrta-jnanah at the present moment,even amongst the scholars of the Gita. In the Gita, in plain and simplelanguage, it is stated that Sri Krsna is the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned asthe father of Brahma, the original father of all human beings. In fact,Sri Krsna is said to be not only the father of Brahma but also thefather of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahmanand Paramatma; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. Heis the fountainhead of everything and everyone is advised to surrenderunto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, themayayapahrta-jnanah deride the personality of the Supreme Lord andconsider Him merely another human being. They do not know that theblessed form of human life is designed after the eternal andtranscendental feature of the Supreme Lord.All the unauthorized interpretations of the Gita by the class ofmayayapahrta-jnanah, outside the purview of the parampara system, areso many stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding. Thedeluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna,nor do they teach others to follow this principle.(4) The last class of duskrti is called asuram bhavam asritah, or thoseof demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them\nargue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world,\nbut they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. Thereare others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, althoughthe opposite is declared in the Gita. Envious of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicitincarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such personswhose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godheadcannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna.Sri Yamunacarya Albandaru of South India said, \"O my Lord! You areunknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles, despite Youruncommon qualities, features, and activities and despite Yourpersonality being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in thequality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famousauthorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendentalscience and situated in the godly qualities.\"Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3)the deluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as abovementioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality ofGodhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice.\nTEXT 16\ncatur-vidha bhajante mam\njanah sukrtino 'rjunaarto jijnasur artharthijnani ca bharatarsabha\nSYNONYMScatuh-vidhah--four kinds of; bhajante--render services; mam--unto Me;\njanah--persons; su-krtinah--those who are pious; arjuna--O Arjuna;artah--the distressed; jijnasuh--the inquisitive; artha-arthi--one whodesires material gain; jnani--one who knows things as they are; ca--also; bharata-rsabha--O great one amongst the descendants of Bharata.\nTRANSLATIONO best among the Bharatas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render\ndevotional service unto Me--the distressed, the desirer of wealth, theinquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.\nPURPORTUnlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles\nof the scriptures, and they are called sukrtinah, or those who obey therules and regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, andare, more or less, devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there arefour classes of men--those who are sometimes distressed, those who arein need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those whoare sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Thesepersons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under differentconditions. These are not pure devotees because they have someaspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Puredevotional service is without aspiration and without desire formaterial profit. The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.11) defines puredevotion thus:\nanyabhilasita-sunyam\njnana-karmady-anavrtam\nanukulyena krsnanu-silanam bhaktir uttama\n\"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord\nKrsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain throughfruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called puredevotional service.\"When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord fordevotional service and are completely purified by the association of apure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreantsare concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult becausetheir lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. Buteven some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a puredevotee, also become pure devotees.Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord inmaterial distress and at that time associate with pure devotees andbecome, in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simplyfrustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees andbecome inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dryphilosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimeswant to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to renderdevotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonalBrahman and the localized Paramatma and come to the personal conceptionof Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On thewhole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge,and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires,and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothingto do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long assuch a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendentalservice to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and theysearch after mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all thisbefore one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.\nTEXT 17\ntesam jnani nitya-yukta\neka-bhaktir visisyatepriyo hi jnanino 'tyarthamaham sa ca mama priyah\nSYNONYMStesam--out of them; jnani--one in full knowledge; nitya-yuktah--always\nengaged; eka--only one; bhaktih--in devotional service; visisyate--especially; priyah--very dear; hi--certainly; jnaninah--person inknowledge; atyartham--highly; aham--I am; sah--he; ca--also; mama--Mine; priyah--dear.\nTRANSLATIONOf these, the wise one who is in full knowledge in union with Me\nthrough pure devotional service is the best.

But out of them, he who is in knowledge ofthe Absolute Truth and free from all material desires becomes a reallypure devotee of the Lord. And of the four orders, the devotee who is infull knowledge and is at the same time engaged in devotional serviceis, the Lord says, the best. By searching after knowledge one realizesthat his self is different from his material body, and when furtheradvanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman and Paramatma.When one is fully purified, he realizes that his constitutionalposition is to be the eternal servant of God. So by association withpure devotees, the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker aftermaterial amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselvespure. But in the preparatory stage, the man who is in full knowledge ofthe Supreme Lord and is at the same time executing devotional serviceis very dear to the Lord. He who is situated in pure knowledge of thetranscendence of the Supreme Personality of God is so protected indevotional service that material contamination cannot touch him.\nTEXT 18\nudarah sarva evaite\njnani tv atmaiva me matamasthitah sa hi yuktatmamam evanuttamam gatim\nSYNONYMSudarah--magnanimous; sarve--all; eva--certainly; ete--these; jnani--one\nwho is in knowledge; tu--but; atma eva--just like Myself; me--My;matam--opinion; asthitah--situated; sah--he; hi--certainly; yukta-atma--engaged in devotional service; mam--unto Me; eva--certainly;anuttamam--the highest goal; gatim--destination.\nTRANSLATIONAll these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is\nsituated in knowledge of Me I consider verily to dwell in Me.

The Lord says that all are magnanimous becauseanyone who comes to the Lord for any purpose is called a mahatma orgreat soul. The devotees who want some benefit out of devotionalservice are accepted by the Lord because there is an exchange ofaffection. Out of affection they ask the Lord for some materialbenefit, and when they get it they become so satisfied that they alsoadvance in devotional service. But the devotee in full knowledge isconsidered to be very dear to the Lord because his only purpose is toserve the Supreme Lord with love and devotion. Such a devotee cannotlive a second without contacting or serving the Supreme Lord.Similarly, the Supreme Lord is very fond of His devotee and cannot beseparated from him.In the Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.4.68), the Lord says:\nsadhavo hrdayam mahyam\nsadhunam hrdayam tv aham\nmad-anyat te na janantinaham tebhyo manag api\n\"The devotees are always in My heart, and I am always in the hearts of\nthe devotees.

In the beginning ofspiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one's attachmentto materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but whenone is further advanced he can understand that there are activities inthe spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotionalservice. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personalityof Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understandthat Lord Sri Krsna's mercy is everything, that He is the cause of allcauses and that this material manifestation is not independent fromHim. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection ofspiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is arelationship with the Supreme Lord Krsna. Thus he thinks of everythingin relation to Vasudeva, or Sri Krsna. Such a universal vision ofVasudeva precipitates one's full surrender to the Supreme Lord SriKrsna as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter (verses 14 and15) of the Svetasvatara Upanisad: \"In this body there are powers ofspeaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental activities, etc. But theseare not important if not related to the Supreme Lord and becauseVasudeva is all-pervading and everything is Vasudeva, the devoteesurrenders in full knowledge (cf. Bhagavad-gita 7.17 and 11.40).\nTEXT 20\nkamais tais tair hrta-jnanah\nprapadyante 'nya-devatahtam tam niyamam asthayaprakrtya niyatah svaya\nSYNONYMSkamaih--by desires; taih--by those; taih--by those; hrta--distorted;\njnanah--knowledge; prapadyante--surrender; anya--other; devatah--demigods; tam--that; tam--that; niyamam--rules; asthaya--following;prakrtya--by nature; niyatah--controlled; svaya--by their own.\nTRANSLATIONThose whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto\ndemigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worshipaccording to their own natures.\nPURPORTThose who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto the\nSupreme Lord and engage in His devotional service. As long as thematerial contamination is not completely washed off, they are by naturenondevotees. But even those who have material desires and who resort tothe Supreme Lord are not so much attracted by external nature; becauseof approaching the right goal, they soon become free from all materiallust. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is recommended that whether one isfree from all material desires, or is full of material desires, ordesires liberation from material contamination, or is a pure devoteeand has no desire for material sense gratification, he should in allcases surrender to Vasudeva and worship Him.It is said in the Bhagavatam that less intelligent people who have losttheir spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediatefulfillment of material desires. Generally, such people do not go tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in particularmodes of nature (ignorance and passion) and therefore worship variousdemigods. Following the rules and regulations of worship, they aresatisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desiresand do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of theSupreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there arerecommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes(e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who arenot devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods arebetter than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows that the SupremeLord Krsna is the master of all. In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 5.142)it is said, ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya: only the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Krsna, is master, and all others are servants.Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of hismaterial needs. He depends on the Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee issatisfied with whatever He gives.\nTEXT 21\nyo yo yam yam tanum bhaktah\nsraddhayarcitum icchatitasya tasyacalam sraddham\ntam eva vidadhamy aham\nSYNONYMSyah--that; yah--that; yam--which; yam--which; tanum--form of the\ndemigods; bhaktah--devotee; sraddhaya--with faith; arcitum--to worship;icchati--desires; tasya--of that; tasya--of that; acalam--steady;sraddham--faith; tam--him; eva--surely; vidadhami--give; aham--I.\nTRANSLATIONI am in everyone's heart as the Supersoul.

Some may ask why the all-powerful Godgives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this materialworld and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. Theanswer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give suchfacilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore Hegives everyone full independence--whatever one likes--but His ultimateinstruction we find in the Bhagavad-gita: man should give up all otherengagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man happy.Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannotworship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow anybenediction without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade ofgrass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to thedemigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wantingsome particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For example,a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a personwanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvati; and aperson wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Uma, the wifeof Lord Siva. In this way there are recommendations in the sastras(Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of differentdemigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy aparticular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strongdesire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and sohe successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of thedevotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type ofdemigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannotinfuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is theSupreme Lord or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts of allliving entities, Krsna gives impetus to man to worship certaindemigods. The demigods are actually different parts of the universalbody of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence. In theVedic literature it is stated: \"The Supreme Personality of Godhead asSupersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod; therefore Hearranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the living\nentity. But both the demigod and the living entity are dependent on the\nsupreme will.

The living entity may forget thateverything is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do notforget. So the worship of demigods and achievement of desired resultsare due not to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,by arrangement. The less intelligent living entity does not know this,and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit. Butthe pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the SupremeLord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a puredevotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is madto fulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired bythe living entity and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. Inthe Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that one who worships the SupremeLord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictoryin his desires. Devotional service of the Supreme Lord and the worshipof a demigod cannot be on the same platform because worship of ademigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord iscompletely spiritual.For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, materialdesires are impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore notawarded the material benefits desired by less intelligent livingentities who prefer to worship demigods of the material world ratherthan engage in devotional service of the Supreme Lord.\nTEXT 23\nantavat tu phalam tesam\ntad bhavaty alpa-medhasamdevan deva-yajo yantimad-bhakta yanti mam api\nSYNONYMS\nanta-vat tu--limited and temporary; phalam--fruits; tesam--their; tat--\nthat; bhavati--becomes; alpa-medhasam--of those of small intelligence;devan--demigods' planets; deva-yajah--worshipers of demigods; yanti--achieve; mat--My; bhaktah--devotees; yanti--attain; mam--to Me; api--surely.\nTRANSLATIONMen of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are\nlimited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planetsof the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.\nPURPORTSome commentators on the Gita say that one who worships a demigod can\nreach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that theworshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems wherevarious demigods are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achievesthe sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon.Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he canattain that particular god's planet. It is not that everyone,regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the SupremePersonality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly statedthat the worshipers of the demigods go to different planets in thematerial world, but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly tothe supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different partsof the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achievedby worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are lessintelligent because they don't know to what part of the body food mustbe supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there aremany parts and many ways to supply food. This isn't very sanguine. Cananyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do notknow that these demigods are different parts of the universal body ofthe Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each andevery demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary livingentities are also. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that thebrahmanas are the head of the Supreme Lord, the ksatriyas are the arms,etc., and that all serve different functions. Regardless of thesituation, if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part andparcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he doesnot understand this, he achieves different planets where the demigodsreside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.The results achieved by the demigods' benedictions are perishablebecause within this material world the planets, the demigods and theirworshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in thisverse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable,and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent livingentity. Because the pure devotee engaged in Krsna consciousness indevotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissfulexistence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of thecommon worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme Lord isunlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Thereforethe mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.\nTEXT 24\navyaktam vyaktim apannam\nmanyante mam abuddhayahparam bhavam ajanantomamavyayam anuttamam\nSYNONYMSavyaktam--nonmanifested; vyaktim--personality; apannam--achieved;\nmanyante--think; mam--unto Me; abuddhayah--less intelligent persons;param--supreme; bhavam--state of being; ajanantah--without knowing;mama--My; avyayam--imperishable; anuttamam--the finest.\nTRANSLATIONUnintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form\nand personality.

Lord Krsna in His personal form is here speaking beforeArjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that theSupreme Lord ultimately has no form. Yamunacarya, a great devotee ofthe Lord in the disciplic succession from Ramanujacarya, has writtentwo very appropriate verses in this connection. He says,\"My dear Lord, devotees like Vyasadeva and Narada know You to be thePersonality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures,one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Youractivities, and one can thus understand that You are the SupremePersonality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion andignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They areunable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be indiscussing Vedanta and the Upanisads and other Vedic literatures, it isnot possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.\"(Stotra-ratna 12)In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the Personality of Godheadcannot be understood simply by study of the Vedanta literature. Only bythe mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme beknown. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only arethe worshipers of the demigods less intelligent, but those nondevoteeswho are engaged in Vedanta and speculation on Vedic literature withoutany tinge of true Krsna consciousness are also less intelligent, andfor them it is not possible to understand God's personal nature.Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth isimpersonal are described as abuddhayah, which means one who does notknow the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from theimpersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul--but theultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead.Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not evenfollow their great predecessor, Sankaracarya, who has specificallystated that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think Krsnato be only the son of Devaki and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerfulliving entity. This is also condemned in the Bhagavad-gita (9.11).\nAvajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam: \"Only the fools regard Me\nas an ordinary person.\"The fact is that no one can understand Krsna without renderingdevotional service and without developing Krsna consciousness. The Gitaconfirms this.One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, or Hisform, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussingVedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. Whenone is fully engaged in Krsna consciousness, beginning by chanting themaha-mantra--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama,Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare--then only can one understand theSupreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think thatKrsna has a body made of this material nature and that all Hisactivities, His form and everything, are maya. These impersonalists areknown as Mayavadis. They do not know the ultimate truth.The twentieth verse clearly states, kamais tais tair hrta-jnanahprapadyante 'nya-devatah. \"Those who are blinded by lusty desiressurrender unto the different demigods.\" It is accepted that besides theSupreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have theirdifferent planets, and the Lord also has a planet. As stated in thetwenty-third verse, devan deva-yajo yanti mad-bhakta yanti mam api: theworshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods,and those who are devotees of Lord Krsna go to the Krsnaloka planet.Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists stillmaintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms areimpositions. From the study of the Gita does it appear that thedemigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigodsnor Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They areall persons; Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Hehas His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless andthat form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here thatit is not imposed. From the Gita we can clearly understand that theforms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord aresimultaneously existing and that Lord Krsna is sac-cid-ananda, eternalblissful knowledge. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme AbsoluteTruth is ananda-mayo, or by nature full of blissful pleasure, and thatHe is abhyasat, by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspiciousqualities. And in the Gita the Lord says that although He is aja(unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we shouldunderstand from the Bhagavad-gita. We cannot understand how the SupremePersonality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of theimpersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the Gita areconcerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, LordKrsna, has both form and personality.\nTEXT 25\nnaham prakasah sarvasya\nyoga-maya-samavrtahmudho 'yam nabhijanatiloko mam ajam avyayam\nSYNONYMSna--nor; aham--I; prakasah--manifest; sarvasya--to everyone; yoga-maya-\n-internal potency; samavrtah--covered; mudhah--foolish; ayam--this; na-\n-not; abhijanati--can understand; lokah--such less intelligent persons;\nmam--Me; ajam--unborn; avyayam--inexhaustible.\nTRANSLATIONI am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am\ncovered by My eternal creative potency [yoga-maya]; and so the deludedworld knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible.\nPURPORTIt may be argued that since Krsna was present on this earth and was\nvisible to everyone, then why isn't He manifest to everyone now? Butactually He was not manifest to everyone. When Krsna was present therewere only a few people who could understand Him to be the SupremePersonality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when Sisupala spokeagainst Krsna being elected president of the assembly, Bhisma supportedHim and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the Pandavasand a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He wasnot revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore in theGita Krsna says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him tobe like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as thereservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees,He was covered by His internal potency.In the prayers of Kunti in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.8.19) it is saidthat the Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-maya and thus ordinarypeople cannot understand Him. This yoga-maya curtain is also confirmedin the Isopanisad (mantra 15), in which the devotee prays:\"O my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, anddevotional service to You is the highest religious principle.Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendentalform is covered by the yoga-maya. The brahmajyoti is the covering ofthe internal potency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgencethat impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, Your eternal formof bliss and knowledge.\"This yoga-maya curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter ofthe Gita. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental formof bliss and knowledge is covered by the internal potency of thebrahmajyoti, and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see theSupreme on this account. Also in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.7) thereis this prayer by Brahma: \"O Supreme Personality of Godhead, OSupersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency andpastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your internal potency,and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learnedscholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world oreven the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energyand potency, although You are present before them.\" The SupremePersonality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, is not only unborn but also avyaya,inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and Hisenergies are all inexhaustible.\nTEXT 26\nvedaham samatitani\nvartamanani carjunabhavisyani ca bhutanimam tu veda na kascana\nSYNONYMS\nveda--know; aham--I; sama--equally; a titani--past; vartamanani--\npresent; ca--and; arjuna--O Arjuna; bhavisyani--future; ca--also;bhutani--living entities; mam--Me; tu--but; veda--knows; na--not;kascana--anyone.\nTRANSLATIONO Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that\nhas happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and allthings that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me noone knows.\nPURPORTHere the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated.\nIf Krsna, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is consideredby the impersonalists to be maya, to be material, then He would, likethe living entity, change His body and forget everything in His pastlife. Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, norcan he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of hispresent life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past,present and future. Unless one is liberated from materialcontamination, he cannot know past, present and future.Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord Krsna clearly says that Hecompletely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in thepresent, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter wehave seen that Lord Krsna remembers instructing Vivasvan, the sun-god,millions of years ago. Krsna knows every living entity because He issituated in every living being's heart as the Supreme Soul. But despiteHis presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presencebeyond the material sky, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, theless intelligent cannot realize Him as the Supreme Person. Certainlythe transcendental body of Sri Krsna is not perishable. He is just likethe sun, and maya is like the cloud. In the material world we can seethat there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars andplanets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, butthis covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon andstars are not actually covered. Similarly, maya cannot cover theSupreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the lessintelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of thischapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to becomeperfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousandsof such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord Krsna is.Even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal Brahman orlocalized Paramatma, he cannot possibly understand the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, without being in Krsnaconsciousness.\nTEXT 27\niccha-dvesa-samutthena\ndvandva-mohena bharatasarva-bhutani sammohamsarge yanti parantapa\nSYNONYMS\niccha--desire; dvesa--hate; samutthena--born; dvandva--duality; mohena-\n-overcome; bharata--O scion of Bharata; sarva--all; bhutani--livingentities; sammoham--into delusion; sarge--in creation; yanti--go;parantapa--O conqueror of enemies.\nTRANSLATIONO scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living\nentities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desireand hate.\nPURPORTThe real constitutional position of the living entity is that of\nsubordination to the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one isdeluded into separation from this pure knowledge, he becomes controlledby illusory energy and cannot understand the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. The illusory energy is manifested in the duality of desire andhate. Due to desire and hate, the ignorant person wants to become onewith the Supreme Lord and envies Krsna as the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Pure devotees, who are not so deluded or contaminated bydesire and hate, can understand that Lord Sri Krsna appears by Hisinternal potencies, but those who are deluded by duality and nesciencethink that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is created by materialenergies. This is their misfortune. Such deluded persons,symptomatically, dwell in dualities of dishonor and honor, misery andhappiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure and pain, etc.,thinking, \"This is my wife; this is my house; I am the master of thishouse; I am the husband of this wife.\" These are the dualities ofdelusion. Those who are so deluded by dualities are completely foolishand therefore cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nTEXT 28\nyesam tv anta-gatam papam\njananam punya-karmanamte dvandva-moha-nirmuktabhajante mam drdha-vratah\nSYNONYMSyesam--whose; tu--but; anta-gatam--completely eradicated; papam--sin;\njananam--of the persons; punya--pious; karmanam--previous activities;te--they; dvandva--duality; moha--delusion; nirmuktah--free from;bhajante--worship; mam--Me; drdha-vratah--with determination.\nTRANSLATIONPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life,\nwhose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed fromthe duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service withdetermination.\nPURPORTThose eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are\nmentioned in this verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish\nand deceitful, it is very difficult to transcend the duality of desire\nand hate. Only those who have passed their lives in practicing theregulative principles of religion, who have acted piously and who haveconquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service and graduallyrise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then,gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritualplatform. This elevation is possible in Krsna consciousness in theassociation of pure devotees who can deliver one from delusion.It is stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.2) that if one actuallywants to be liberated he must render service to the devotees (mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh); but one who associates with materialisticpeople is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence (tamo-dvaram yositam sangi-sangam). All the devotees of the Lord traversethis earth just to recover the conditioned souls from their delusion.The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their constitutionalposition as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest violationof God's law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutionalposition, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality orto be fully engaged in His transcendental loving service withdetermination.\nTEXT 29\njara-marana-moksaya\nmam asritya yatanti yete brahma tad viduh krtsnamadhyatmam karma cakhilam\nSYNONYMSjara--old age; marana--death; moksaya--for the purpose of liberation;\nmam--unto Me; asritya--taking shelter of; yatanti--endeavor; ye--allthose; te--such persons; brahma--Brahman; tat--actually that; viduh--they know; krtsnam--everything; adhyatmam--transcendental; karma--fruitive activities; ca--and; akhilam--entirely.\nTRANSLATIONIntelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and\ndeath take refuge in Me in devotional service.

There is no birth, death, old age and disease forthe spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one ofthe associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages ineternal devotional service, is really liberated. Aham brahmasmi: I amspirit. It is said that one should understand that he is Brahman--spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is also in devotionalservice, as described in this verse. The pure devotees aretranscendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they knoweverything about transcendental and material activities.\nFour kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the\ntranscendental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, andby the grace of the Supreme Lord, when they are fully Krsna conscious,they actually enjoy spiritual association with the Supreme Lord. Butthose who are worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord inHis supreme planet. Even the less intelligent Brahman-realized personscannot reach the supreme planet of Krsna known as Goloka Vrndavana.Only persons who perform activities in Krsna consciousness (mamasritya) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they areactually endeavoring to reach the Krsna planet. Such persons have nomisgivings about Krsna, and thus they are factually Brahman.Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or arca of the Lord, orwho are engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation frommaterial bondage, also know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports ofBrahman, adhibhuta, etc., as explained by the Lord in the next chapter.\nTEXT 30\nsadhibhutadhidaivam mam\nsadhiyajnam ca ye viduhprayana-kale 'pi ca mamte vidur yukta-cetasah\nSYNONYMSsa-adhibhuta--the governing principle of the material manifestation;\nadhidaivam--underlying all the demigods; mam--Me; sa-adhiyajnam--sustaining all sacrifices; ca--and; ye--those; viduh--know; prayana--ofdeath; kale--at the time; api--even; ca--and; mam--Me; te--they; viduh--know; yukta-cetasah--with steadfast minds.\nTRANSLATIONThose who know Me as the Supreme Lord, as the governing principle of\nthe material manifestation, who know Me as the one underlying all thedemigods and as the one sustaining all sacrifices, can, with steadfastmind, understand and know Me, even at the time of death.\nPURPORTPersons acting in Krsna consciousness are never entirely deviated from\nthe path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In thetranscendental association of Krsna consciousness, one can understandhow the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the materialmanifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by suchtranscendental association, one becomes convinced of the SupremePersonality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a Krsnaconscious person can never forget Krsna. Naturally he is thus promotedto the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Vrndavana.This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fullyKrsna conscious person. The beginning of Krsna consciousness isassociation of persons who are in Krsna consciousness. Such associationis spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and,by His grace, one can understand Krsna to be the Supreme God. At thesame time one can really understand the constitutional position of theliving entity and how the living entity forgets Krsna and becomesentangled in material activities. By gradual development of Krsnaconsciousness in good association, the living entity can understand\nthat due to forgetfulness of Krsna he has become conditioned by the\nlaws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form oflife is an opportunity to regain Krsna consciousness and that it shouldbe fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress,the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledgeof Brahman, knowledge of Paramatma, liberation from birth, death anddiseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actuallyelevated in Krsna consciousness does not care for the differentprocesses. He simply directly engages himself in activities of Krsnaconsciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional positionas an eternal servitor of Lord Krsna. In such a situation he takespleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotionalservice. He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will befulfilled. This determined faith is called drdha-vrata, and that is thebeginning of bhakti-yoga or transcendental loving service. That is theverdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the Gita is thesubstance of that conviction.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the\nSrimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute."

That is the vision of a true devotee.Sri Nityananda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divinemaster, delivered the typical naradhamas, the brothers Jagai andMadhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon thelowest of mankind. So the naradhama who is condemned by the Personalityof Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by themercy of a devotee.Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in propagating the bhagavata-dharma oractivities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissivelyhear the message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of thismessage is Bhagavad-gita. The lowest amongst human beings can bedelivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunatelythey even deny giving an aural reception to these messages, and what tospeak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Naradhamas, orthe lowest of mankind, will fully neglect the prime duty of the humanbeing.(3) The next class of duskrti is called mayayapahrta-jnanah, or thosepersons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence ofillusory material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows--greatphilosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc.--but the illusoryenergy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.There are a great number of mayayapahrta-jnanah at the present moment,even amongst the scholars of the Gita. In the Gita, in plain and simplelanguage, it is stated that Sri Krsna is the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned asthe father of Brahma, the original father of all human beings. In fact,Sri Krsna is said to be not only the father of Brahma but also thefather of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahmanand Paramatma; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. Heis the fountainhead of everything and everyone is advised to surrenderunto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, themayayapahrta-jnanah deride the personality of the Supreme Lord andconsider Him merely another human being. They do not know that theblessed form of human life is designed after the eternal andtranscendental feature of the Supreme Lord.All the unauthorized interpretations of the Gita by the class ofmayayapahrta-jnanah, outside the purview of the parampara system, areso many stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding. Thedeluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna,nor do they teach others to follow this principle.(4) The last class of duskrti is called asuram bhavam asritah, or thoseof demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them\nargue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world,\nbut they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. Thereare others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, althoughthe opposite is declared in the Gita. Envious of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicitincarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such personswhose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godheadcannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna.Sri Yamunacarya Albandaru of South India said, \"O my Lord! You areunknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles, despite Youruncommon qualities, features, and activities and despite Yourpersonality being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in thequality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famousauthorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendentalscience and situated in the godly qualities.\"Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3)the deluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as abovementioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality ofGodhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice.\nTEXT 16\ncatur-vidha bhajante mam\njanah sukrtino 'rjunaarto jijnasur artharthijnani ca bharatarsabha\nSYNONYMScatuh-vidhah--four kinds of; bhajante--render services; mam--unto Me;\njanah--persons; su-krtinah--those who are pious; arjuna--O Arjuna;artah--the distressed; jijnasuh--the inquisitive; artha-arthi--one whodesires material gain; jnani--one who knows things as they are; ca--also; bharata-rsabha--O great one amongst the descendants of Bharata.\nTRANSLATIONO best among the Bharatas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render\ndevotional service unto Me--the distressed, the desirer of wealth, theinquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.\nPURPORTUnlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles\nof the scriptures, and they are called sukrtinah, or those who obey therules and regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, andare, more or less, devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there arefour classes of men--those who are sometimes distressed, those who arein need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those whoare sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Thesepersons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under differentconditions. These are not pure devotees because they have someaspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Puredevotional service is without aspiration and without desire formaterial profit. The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.11) defines puredevotion thus:\nanyabhilasita-sunyam\njnana-karmady-anavrtam\nanukulyena krsnanu-silanam bhaktir uttama\n\"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord\nKrsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain throughfruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called puredevotional service.\"When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord fordevotional service and are completely purified by the association of apure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreantsare concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult becausetheir lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. Buteven some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a puredevotee, also become pure devotees.Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord inmaterial distress and at that time associate with pure devotees andbecome, in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simplyfrustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees andbecome inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dryphilosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimeswant to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to renderdevotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonalBrahman and the localized Paramatma and come to the personal conceptionof Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On thewhole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge,and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires,and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothingto do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long assuch a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendentalservice to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and theysearch after mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all thisbefore one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.\nTEXT 17\ntesam jnani nitya-yukta\neka-bhaktir visisyatepriyo hi jnanino 'tyarthamaham sa ca mama priyah\nSYNONYMStesam--out of them; jnani--one in full knowledge; nitya-yuktah--always\nengaged; eka--only one; bhaktih--in devotional service; visisyate--especially; priyah--very dear; hi--certainly; jnaninah--person inknowledge; atyartham--highly; aham--I am; sah--he; ca--also; mama--Mine; priyah--dear.\nTRANSLATIONOf these, the wise one who is in full knowledge in union with Me\nthrough pure devotional service is the best.

And of the four orders, the devotee who is infull knowledge and is at the same time engaged in devotional serviceis, the Lord says, the best. By searching after knowledge one realizesthat his self is different from his material body, and when furtheradvanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman and Paramatma.When one is fully purified, he realizes that his constitutionalposition is to be the eternal servant of God. So by association withpure devotees, the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker aftermaterial amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselvespure. But in the preparatory stage, the man who is in full knowledge ofthe Supreme Lord and is at the same time executing devotional serviceis very dear to the Lord. He who is situated in pure knowledge of thetranscendence of the Supreme Personality of God is so protected indevotional service that material contamination cannot touch him.\nTEXT 18\nudarah sarva evaite\njnani tv atmaiva me matamasthitah sa hi yuktatmamam evanuttamam gatim\nSYNONYMSudarah--magnanimous; sarve--all; eva--certainly; ete--these; jnani--one\nwho is in knowledge; tu--but; atma eva--just like Myself; me--My;matam--opinion; asthitah--situated; sah--he; hi--certainly; yukta-atma--engaged in devotional service; mam--unto Me; eva--certainly;anuttamam--the highest goal; gatim--destination.\nTRANSLATIONAll these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is\nsituated in knowledge of Me I consider verily to dwell in Me.

The Lord says that all are magnanimous becauseanyone who comes to the Lord for any purpose is called a mahatma orgreat soul. The devotees who want some benefit out of devotionalservice are accepted by the Lord because there is an exchange ofaffection. Out of affection they ask the Lord for some materialbenefit, and when they get it they become so satisfied that they alsoadvance in devotional service. But the devotee in full knowledge isconsidered to be very dear to the Lord because his only purpose is toserve the Supreme Lord with love and devotion. Such a devotee cannotlive a second without contacting or serving the Supreme Lord.Similarly, the Supreme Lord is very fond of His devotee and cannot beseparated from him.In the Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.4.68), the Lord says:\nsadhavo hrdayam mahyam\nsadhunam hrdayam tv aham\nmad-anyat te na janantinaham tebhyo manag api\n\"The devotees are always in My heart, and I am always in the hearts of\nthe devotees.

In the beginning ofspiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one's attachmentto materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but whenone is further advanced he can understand that there are activities inthe spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotionalservice. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personalityof Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understandthat Lord Sri Krsna's mercy is everything, that He is the cause of allcauses and that this material manifestation is not independent fromHim. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection ofspiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is arelationship with the Supreme Lord Krsna. Thus he thinks of everythingin relation to Vasudeva, or Sri Krsna. Such a universal vision ofVasudeva precipitates one's full surrender to the Supreme Lord SriKrsna as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter (verses 14 and15) of the Svetasvatara Upanisad: \"In this body there are powers ofspeaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental activities, etc. But theseare not important if not related to the Supreme Lord and becauseVasudeva is all-pervading and everything is Vasudeva, the devoteesurrenders in full knowledge (cf. Bhagavad-gita 7.17 and 11.40).\nTEXT 20\nkamais tais tair hrta-jnanah\nprapadyante 'nya-devatahtam tam niyamam asthayaprakrtya niyatah svaya\nSYNONYMSkamaih--by desires; taih--by those; taih--by those; hrta--distorted;\njnanah--knowledge; prapadyante--surrender; anya--other; devatah--demigods; tam--that; tam--that; niyamam--rules; asthaya--following;prakrtya--by nature; niyatah--controlled; svaya--by their own.\nTRANSLATIONThose whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto\ndemigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worshipaccording to their own natures.\nPURPORTThose who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto the\nSupreme Lord and engage in His devotional service. As long as thematerial contamination is not completely washed off, they are by naturenondevotees. But even those who have material desires and who resort tothe Supreme Lord are not so much attracted by external nature; becauseof approaching the right goal, they soon become free from all materiallust. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is recommended that whether one isfree from all material desires, or is full of material desires, ordesires liberation from material contamination, or is a pure devoteeand has no desire for material sense gratification, he should in allcases surrender to Vasudeva and worship Him.It is said in the Bhagavatam that less intelligent people who have losttheir spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediatefulfillment of material desires. Generally, such people do not go tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in particularmodes of nature (ignorance and passion) and therefore worship variousdemigods. Following the rules and regulations of worship, they aresatisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desiresand do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of theSupreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there arerecommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes(e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who arenot devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods arebetter than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows that the SupremeLord Krsna is the master of all. In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 5.142)it is said, ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya: only the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Krsna, is master, and all others are servants.Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of hismaterial needs. He depends on the Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee issatisfied with whatever He gives.\nTEXT 21\nyo yo yam yam tanum bhaktah\nsraddhayarcitum icchatitasya tasyacalam sraddham\ntam eva vidadhamy aham\nSYNONYMSyah--that; yah--that; yam--which; yam--which; tanum--form of the\ndemigods; bhaktah--devotee; sraddhaya--with faith; arcitum--to worship;icchati--desires; tasya--of that; tasya--of that; acalam--steady;sraddham--faith; tam--him; eva--surely; vidadhami--give; aham--I.\nTRANSLATIONI am in everyone's heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to\nworship the demigods, I make his faith steady so that he can devotehimself to some particular deity.\nPURPORTGod has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires\nto have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have suchfacilities from the material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoulin everyone's heart, understands and gives facilities to such persons.As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interferewith their independence, but gives all facilities so that they canfulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the all-powerful Godgives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this materialworld and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. Theanswer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give suchfacilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore Hegives everyone full independence--whatever one likes--but His ultimateinstruction we find in the Bhagavad-gita: man should give up all otherengagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man happy.Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannotworship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow anybenediction without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade ofgrass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to thedemigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wantingsome particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For example,a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a personwanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvati; and aperson wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Uma, the wifeof Lord Siva. In this way there are recommendations in the sastras(Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of differentdemigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy aparticular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strongdesire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and sohe successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of thedevotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type ofdemigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannotinfuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is theSupreme Lord or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts of allliving entities, Krsna gives impetus to man to worship certaindemigods. The demigods are actually different parts of the universalbody of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence. In theVedic literature it is stated: \"The Supreme Personality of Godhead asSupersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod; therefore Hearranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the living\nentity. But both the demigod and the living entity are dependent on the\nsupreme will. They are not independent.\"\nTEXT 22\nsa taya sraddhaya yuktas\ntasyaradhanam ihatelabhate ca tatah kamanmayaiva vihitan hi tan\nSYNONYMSsah--he; taya--with that; sraddhaya--with faith; yuktah--endowed;\ntasya--his; aradhanam--worship; ihate--seeks; labhate--obtains; ca--and; tatah--from which; kaman--desires; maya--by Me; eva--alone;vihitan--regulated; hi--for; tan--those.\nTRANSLATIONEndowed with such a faith, he seeks favors of a particular demigod and\nobtains his desires.

The living entity may forget thateverything is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do notforget. So the worship of demigods and achievement of desired resultsare due not to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,by arrangement. The less intelligent living entity does not know this,and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit. Butthe pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the SupremeLord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a puredevotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is madto fulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired bythe living entity and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. Inthe Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that one who worships the SupremeLord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictoryin his desires. Devotional service of the Supreme Lord and the worshipof a demigod cannot be on the same platform because worship of ademigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord iscompletely spiritual.For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, materialdesires are impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore notawarded the material benefits desired by less intelligent livingentities who prefer to worship demigods of the material world ratherthan engage in devotional service of the Supreme Lord.\nTEXT 23\nantavat tu phalam tesam\ntad bhavaty alpa-medhasamdevan deva-yajo yantimad-bhakta yanti mam api\nSYNONYMS\nanta-vat tu--limited and temporary; phalam--fruits; tesam--their; tat--\nthat; bhavati--becomes; alpa-medhasam--of those of small intelligence;devan--demigods' planets; deva-yajah--worshipers of demigods; yanti--achieve; mat--My; bhaktah--devotees; yanti--attain; mam--to Me; api--surely.\nTRANSLATIONMen of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are\nlimited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planetsof the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.\nPURPORTSome commentators on the Gita say that one who worships a demigod can\nreach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that theworshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems wherevarious demigods are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achievesthe sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon.Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he canattain that particular god's planet. It is not that everyone,regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the SupremePersonality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly statedthat the worshipers of the demigods go to different planets in thematerial world, but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly tothe supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different partsof the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achievedby worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are lessintelligent because they don't know to what part of the body food mustbe supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there aremany parts and many ways to supply food. This isn't very sanguine. Cananyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do notknow that these demigods are different parts of the universal body ofthe Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each andevery demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary livingentities are also. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that thebrahmanas are the head of the Supreme Lord, the ksatriyas are the arms,etc., and that all serve different functions. Regardless of thesituation, if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part andparcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he doesnot understand this, he achieves different planets where the demigodsreside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.The results achieved by the demigods' benedictions are perishablebecause within this material world the planets, the demigods and theirworshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in thisverse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable,and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent livingentity. Because the pure devotee engaged in Krsna consciousness indevotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissfulexistence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of thecommon worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme Lord isunlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Thereforethe mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.\nTEXT 24\navyaktam vyaktim apannam\nmanyante mam abuddhayahparam bhavam ajanantomamavyayam anuttamam\nSYNONYMSavyaktam--nonmanifested; vyaktim--personality; apannam--achieved;\nmanyante--think; mam--unto Me; abuddhayah--less intelligent persons;param--supreme; bhavam--state of being; ajanantah--without knowing;mama--My; avyayam--imperishable; anuttamam--the finest.\nTRANSLATIONUnintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form\nand personality.

Lord Krsna in His personal form is here speaking beforeArjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that theSupreme Lord ultimately has no form. Yamunacarya, a great devotee ofthe Lord in the disciplic succession from Ramanujacarya, has writtentwo very appropriate verses in this connection. He says,\"My dear Lord, devotees like Vyasadeva and Narada know You to be thePersonality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures,one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Youractivities, and one can thus understand that You are the SupremePersonality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion andignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They areunable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be indiscussing Vedanta and the Upanisads and other Vedic literatures, it isnot possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.\"(Stotra-ratna 12)In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the Personality of Godheadcannot be understood simply by study of the Vedanta literature. Only bythe mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme beknown. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only arethe worshipers of the demigods less intelligent, but those nondevoteeswho are engaged in Vedanta and speculation on Vedic literature withoutany tinge of true Krsna consciousness are also less intelligent, andfor them it is not possible to understand God's personal nature.Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth isimpersonal are described as abuddhayah, which means one who does notknow the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from theimpersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul--but theultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead.Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not evenfollow their great predecessor, Sankaracarya, who has specificallystated that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think Krsnato be only the son of Devaki and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerfulliving entity. This is also condemned in the Bhagavad-gita (9.11).\nAvajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam: \"Only the fools regard Me\nas an ordinary person.\"The fact is that no one can understand Krsna without renderingdevotional service and without developing Krsna consciousness. The Gitaconfirms this.One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, or Hisform, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussingVedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. Whenone is fully engaged in Krsna consciousness, beginning by chanting themaha-mantra--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama,Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare--then only can one understand theSupreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think thatKrsna has a body made of this material nature and that all Hisactivities, His form and everything, are maya. These impersonalists areknown as Mayavadis. They do not know the ultimate truth.The twentieth verse clearly states, kamais tais tair hrta-jnanahprapadyante 'nya-devatah. \"Those who are blinded by lusty desiressurrender unto the different demigods.\" It is accepted that besides theSupreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have theirdifferent planets, and the Lord also has a planet. As stated in thetwenty-third verse, devan deva-yajo yanti mad-bhakta yanti mam api: theworshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods,and those who are devotees of Lord Krsna go to the Krsnaloka planet.Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists stillmaintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms areimpositions. From the study of the Gita does it appear that thedemigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigodsnor Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They areall persons; Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Hehas His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless andthat form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here thatit is not imposed. From the Gita we can clearly understand that theforms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord aresimultaneously existing and that Lord Krsna is sac-cid-ananda, eternalblissful knowledge. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme AbsoluteTruth is ananda-mayo, or by nature full of blissful pleasure, and thatHe is abhyasat, by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspiciousqualities. And in the Gita the Lord says that although He is aja(unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we shouldunderstand from the Bhagavad-gita. We cannot understand how the SupremePersonality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of theimpersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the Gita areconcerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, LordKrsna, has both form and personality.\nTEXT 25\nnaham prakasah sarvasya\nyoga-maya-samavrtahmudho 'yam nabhijanatiloko mam ajam avyayam\nSYNONYMSna--nor; aham--I; prakasah--manifest; sarvasya--to everyone; yoga-maya-\n-internal potency; samavrtah--covered; mudhah--foolish; ayam--this; na-\n-not; abhijanati--can understand; lokah--such less intelligent persons;\nmam--Me; ajam--unborn; avyayam--inexhaustible.\nTRANSLATIONI am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent.

Butactually He was not manifest to everyone. When Krsna was present therewere only a few people who could understand Him to be the SupremePersonality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when Sisupala spokeagainst Krsna being elected president of the assembly, Bhisma supportedHim and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the Pandavasand a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He wasnot revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore in theGita Krsna says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him tobe like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as thereservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees,He was covered by His internal potency.In the prayers of Kunti in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.8.19) it is saidthat the Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-maya and thus ordinarypeople cannot understand Him. This yoga-maya curtain is also confirmedin the Isopanisad (mantra 15), in which the devotee prays:\"O my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, anddevotional service to You is the highest religious principle.Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendentalform is covered by the yoga-maya. The brahmajyoti is the covering ofthe internal potency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgencethat impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, Your eternal formof bliss and knowledge.\"This yoga-maya curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter ofthe Gita. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental formof bliss and knowledge is covered by the internal potency of thebrahmajyoti, and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see theSupreme on this account. Also in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.7) thereis this prayer by Brahma: \"O Supreme Personality of Godhead, OSupersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency andpastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your internal potency,and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learnedscholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world oreven the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energyand potency, although You are present before them.\" The SupremePersonality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, is not only unborn but also avyaya,inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and Hisenergies are all inexhaustible.\nTEXT 26\nvedaham samatitani\nvartamanani carjunabhavisyani ca bhutanimam tu veda na kascana\nSYNONYMS\nveda--know; aham--I; sama--equally; a titani--past; vartamanani--\npresent; ca--and; arjuna--O Arjuna; bhavisyani--future; ca--also;bhutani--living entities; mam--Me; tu--but; veda--knows; na--not;kascana--anyone.\nTRANSLATIONO Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that\nhas happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and allthings that are yet to come.

Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, norcan he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of hispresent life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past,present and future. Unless one is liberated from materialcontamination, he cannot know past, present and future.Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord Krsna clearly says that Hecompletely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in thepresent, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter wehave seen that Lord Krsna remembers instructing Vivasvan, the sun-god,millions of years ago. Krsna knows every living entity because He issituated in every living being's heart as the Supreme Soul. But despiteHis presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presencebeyond the material sky, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, theless intelligent cannot realize Him as the Supreme Person. Certainlythe transcendental body of Sri Krsna is not perishable. He is just likethe sun, and maya is like the cloud. In the material world we can seethat there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars andplanets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, butthis covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon andstars are not actually covered. Similarly, maya cannot cover theSupreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the lessintelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of thischapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to becomeperfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousandsof such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord Krsna is.Even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal Brahman orlocalized Paramatma, he cannot possibly understand the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, without being in Krsnaconsciousness.\nTEXT 27\niccha-dvesa-samutthena\ndvandva-mohena bharatasarva-bhutani sammohamsarge yanti parantapa\nSYNONYMS\niccha--desire; dvesa--hate; samutthena--born; dvandva--duality; mohena-\n-overcome; bharata--O scion of Bharata; sarva--all; bhutani--livingentities; sammoham--into delusion; sarge--in creation; yanti--go;parantapa--O conqueror of enemies.\nTRANSLATIONO scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living\nentities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desireand hate.\nPURPORTThe real constitutional position of the living entity is that of\nsubordination to the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one isdeluded into separation from this pure knowledge, he becomes controlledby illusory energy and cannot understand the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. The illusory energy is manifested in the duality of desire andhate. Due to desire and hate, the ignorant person wants to become onewith the Supreme Lord and envies Krsna as the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Pure devotees, who are not so deluded or contaminated bydesire and hate, can understand that Lord Sri Krsna appears by Hisinternal potencies, but those who are deluded by duality and nesciencethink that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is created by materialenergies. This is their misfortune. Such deluded persons,symptomatically, dwell in dualities of dishonor and honor, misery andhappiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure and pain, etc.,thinking, \"This is my wife; this is my house; I am the master of thishouse; I am the husband of this wife.\" These are the dualities ofdelusion.

Then,gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritualplatform. This elevation is possible in Krsna consciousness in theassociation of pure devotees who can deliver one from delusion.It is stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.2) that if one actuallywants to be liberated he must render service to the devotees (mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh); but one who associates with materialisticpeople is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence (tamo-dvaram yositam sangi-sangam). All the devotees of the Lord traversethis earth just to recover the conditioned souls from their delusion.The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their constitutionalposition as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest violationof God's law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutionalposition, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality orto be fully engaged in His transcendental loving service withdetermination.\nTEXT 29\njara-marana-moksaya\nmam asritya yatanti yete brahma tad viduh krtsnamadhyatmam karma cakhilam\nSYNONYMSjara--old age; marana--death; moksaya--for the purpose of liberation;\nmam--unto Me; asritya--taking shelter of; yatanti--endeavor; ye--allthose; te--such persons; brahma--Brahman; tat--actually that; viduh--they know; krtsnam--everything; adhyatmam--transcendental; karma--fruitive activities; ca--and; akhilam--entirely.\nTRANSLATIONIntelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and\ndeath take refuge in Me in devotional service.

There is no birth, death, old age and disease forthe spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one ofthe associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages ineternal devotional service, is really liberated. Aham brahmasmi: I amspirit. It is said that one should understand that he is Brahman--spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is also in devotionalservice, as described in this verse. The pure devotees aretranscendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they knoweverything about transcendental and material activities.\nFour kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the\ntranscendental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, andby the grace of the Supreme Lord, when they are fully Krsna conscious,they actually enjoy spiritual association with the Supreme Lord. Butthose who are worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord inHis supreme planet. Even the less intelligent Brahman-realized personscannot reach the supreme planet of Krsna known as Goloka Vrndavana.Only persons who perform activities in Krsna consciousness (mamasritya) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they areactually endeavoring to reach the Krsna planet. Such persons have nomisgivings about Krsna, and thus they are factually Brahman.Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or arca of the Lord, orwho are engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation frommaterial bondage, also know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports ofBrahman, adhibhuta, etc., as explained by the Lord in the next chapter.\nTEXT 30\nsadhibhutadhidaivam mam\nsadhiyajnam ca ye viduhprayana-kale 'pi ca mamte vidur yukta-cetasah\nSYNONYMSsa-adhibhuta--the governing principle of the material manifestation;\nadhidaivam--underlying all the demigods; mam--Me; sa-adhiyajnam--sustaining all sacrifices; ca--and; ye--those; viduh--know; prayana--ofdeath; kale--at the time; api--even; ca--and; mam--Me; te--they; viduh--know; yukta-cetasah--with steadfast minds.\nTRANSLATIONThose who know Me as the Supreme Lord, as the governing principle of\nthe material manifestation, who know Me as the one underlying all thedemigods and as the one sustaining all sacrifices, can, with steadfastmind, understand and know Me, even at the time of death.\nPURPORTPersons acting in Krsna consciousness are never entirely deviated from\nthe path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In thetranscendental association of Krsna consciousness, one can understandhow the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the materialmanifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by suchtranscendental association, one becomes convinced of the SupremePersonality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a Krsnaconscious person can never forget Krsna. Naturally he is thus promotedto the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Vrndavana.This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fullyKrsna conscious person. The beginning of Krsna consciousness isassociation of persons who are in Krsna consciousness. Such associationis spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and,by His grace, one can understand Krsna to be the Supreme God. At thesame time one can really understand the constitutional position of theliving entity and how the living entity forgets Krsna and becomesentangled in material activities. By gradual development of Krsnaconsciousness in good association, the living entity can understand\nthat due to forgetfulness of Krsna he has become conditioned by the\nlaws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form oflife is an opportunity to regain Krsna consciousness and that it shouldbe fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress,the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledgeof Brahman, knowledge of Paramatma, liberation from birth, death anddiseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actuallyelevated in Krsna consciousness does not care for the differentprocesses. He simply directly engages himself in activities of Krsnaconsciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional positionas an eternal servitor of Lord Krsna. In such a situation he takespleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotionalservice. He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will befulfilled. This determined faith is called drdha-vrata, and that is thebeginning of bhakti-yoga or transcendental loving service. That is theverdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the Gita is thesubstance of that conviction.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the\nSrimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute."

According to the standard of the Gita, a learned manis he who sees on equal terms the learned brahmana, the dog, the cow,the elephant and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee.Sri Nityananda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divinemaster, delivered the typical naradhamas, the brothers Jagai andMadhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon thelowest of mankind. So the naradhama who is condemned by the Personalityof Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by themercy of a devotee.Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in propagating the bhagavata-dharma oractivities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissivelyhear the message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of thismessage is Bhagavad-gita. The lowest amongst human beings can bedelivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunatelythey even deny giving an aural reception to these messages, and what tospeak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Naradhamas, orthe lowest of mankind, will fully neglect the prime duty of the humanbeing.(3) The next class of duskrti is called mayayapahrta-jnanah, or thosepersons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence ofillusory material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows--greatphilosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc.--but the illusoryenergy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.There are a great number of mayayapahrta-jnanah at the present moment,even amongst the scholars of the Gita. In the Gita, in plain and simplelanguage, it is stated that Sri Krsna is the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned asthe father of Brahma, the original father of all human beings. In fact,Sri Krsna is said to be not only the father of Brahma but also thefather of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahmanand Paramatma; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. Heis the fountainhead of everything and everyone is advised to surrenderunto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, themayayapahrta-jnanah deride the personality of the Supreme Lord andconsider Him merely another human being. They do not know that theblessed form of human life is designed after the eternal andtranscendental feature of the Supreme Lord.All the unauthorized interpretations of the Gita by the class ofmayayapahrta-jnanah, outside the purview of the parampara system, areso many stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding. Thedeluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna,nor do they teach others to follow this principle.(4) The last class of duskrti is called asuram bhavam asritah, or thoseof demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them\nargue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world,\nbut they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. Thereare others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, althoughthe opposite is declared in the Gita. Envious of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicitincarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such personswhose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godheadcannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna.Sri Yamunacarya Albandaru of South India said, \"O my Lord! You areunknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles, despite Youruncommon qualities, features, and activities and despite Yourpersonality being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in thequality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famousauthorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendentalscience and situated in the godly qualities.\"Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3)the deluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as abovementioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality ofGodhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice.\nTEXT 16\ncatur-vidha bhajante mam\njanah sukrtino 'rjunaarto jijnasur artharthijnani ca bharatarsabha\nSYNONYMScatuh-vidhah--four kinds of; bhajante--render services; mam--unto Me;\njanah--persons; su-krtinah--those who are pious; arjuna--O Arjuna;artah--the distressed; jijnasuh--the inquisitive; artha-arthi--one whodesires material gain; jnani--one who knows things as they are; ca--also; bharata-rsabha--O great one amongst the descendants of Bharata.\nTRANSLATIONO best among the Bharatas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render\ndevotional service unto Me--the distressed, the desirer of wealth, theinquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.\nPURPORTUnlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles\nof the scriptures, and they are called sukrtinah, or those who obey therules and regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, andare, more or less, devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there arefour classes of men--those who are sometimes distressed, those who arein need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those whoare sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Thesepersons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under differentconditions. These are not pure devotees because they have someaspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Puredevotional service is without aspiration and without desire formaterial profit. The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.11) defines puredevotion thus:\nanyabhilasita-sunyam\njnana-karmady-anavrtam\nanukulyena krsnanu-silanam bhaktir uttama\n\"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord\nKrsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain throughfruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called puredevotional service.\"When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord fordevotional service and are completely purified by the association of apure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreantsare concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult becausetheir lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. Buteven some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a puredevotee, also become pure devotees.Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord inmaterial distress and at that time associate with pure devotees andbecome, in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simplyfrustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees andbecome inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dryphilosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimeswant to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to renderdevotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonalBrahman and the localized Paramatma and come to the personal conceptionof Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On thewhole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge,and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires,and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothingto do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long assuch a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendentalservice to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and theysearch after mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all thisbefore one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.\nTEXT 17\ntesam jnani nitya-yukta\neka-bhaktir visisyatepriyo hi jnanino 'tyarthamaham sa ca mama priyah\nSYNONYMStesam--out of them; jnani--one in full knowledge; nitya-yuktah--always\nengaged; eka--only one; bhaktih--in devotional service; visisyate--especially; priyah--very dear; hi--certainly; jnaninah--person inknowledge; atyartham--highly; aham--I am; sah--he; ca--also; mama--Mine; priyah--dear.\nTRANSLATIONOf these, the wise one who is in full knowledge in union with Me\nthrough pure devotional service is the best.

But out of them, he who is in knowledge ofthe Absolute Truth and free from all material desires becomes a reallypure devotee of the Lord. And of the four orders, the devotee who is infull knowledge and is at the same time engaged in devotional serviceis, the Lord says, the best. By searching after knowledge one realizesthat his self is different from his material body, and when furtheradvanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman and Paramatma.When one is fully purified, he realizes that his constitutionalposition is to be the eternal servant of God. So by association withpure devotees, the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker aftermaterial amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselvespure. But in the preparatory stage, the man who is in full knowledge ofthe Supreme Lord and is at the same time executing devotional serviceis very dear to the Lord. He who is situated in pure knowledge of thetranscendence of the Supreme Personality of God is so protected indevotional service that material contamination cannot touch him.\nTEXT 18\nudarah sarva evaite\njnani tv atmaiva me matamasthitah sa hi yuktatmamam evanuttamam gatim\nSYNONYMSudarah--magnanimous; sarve--all; eva--certainly; ete--these; jnani--one\nwho is in knowledge; tu--but; atma eva--just like Myself; me--My;matam--opinion; asthitah--situated; sah--he; hi--certainly; yukta-atma--engaged in devotional service; mam--unto Me; eva--certainly;anuttamam--the highest goal; gatim--destination.\nTRANSLATIONAll these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is\nsituated in knowledge of Me I consider verily to dwell in Me.

The Lord says that all are magnanimous becauseanyone who comes to the Lord for any purpose is called a mahatma orgreat soul. The devotees who want some benefit out of devotionalservice are accepted by the Lord because there is an exchange ofaffection. Out of affection they ask the Lord for some materialbenefit, and when they get it they become so satisfied that they alsoadvance in devotional service. But the devotee in full knowledge isconsidered to be very dear to the Lord because his only purpose is toserve the Supreme Lord with love and devotion. Such a devotee cannotlive a second without contacting or serving the Supreme Lord.Similarly, the Supreme Lord is very fond of His devotee and cannot beseparated from him.In the Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.4.68), the Lord says:\nsadhavo hrdayam mahyam\nsadhunam hrdayam tv aham\nmad-anyat te na janantinaham tebhyo manag api\n\"The devotees are always in My heart, and I am always in the hearts of\nthe devotees. The devotee does not know anything beyond Me, and I alsocannot forget the devotee. There is a very intimate relationshipbetween Me and the pure devotees.

Such a great soul is very rare.\nPURPORTThe living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental\nrituals after many, many births, may actually become situated intranscendental pure knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godheadis the ultimate goal of spiritual realization. In the beginning ofspiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one's attachmentto materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but whenone is further advanced he can understand that there are activities inthe spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotionalservice. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personalityof Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understandthat Lord Sri Krsna's mercy is everything, that He is the cause of allcauses and that this material manifestation is not independent fromHim. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection ofspiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is arelationship with the Supreme Lord Krsna. Thus he thinks of everythingin relation to Vasudeva, or Sri Krsna. Such a universal vision ofVasudeva precipitates one's full surrender to the Supreme Lord SriKrsna as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter (verses 14 and15) of the Svetasvatara Upanisad: \"In this body there are powers ofspeaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental activities, etc. But theseare not important if not related to the Supreme Lord and becauseVasudeva is all-pervading and everything is Vasudeva, the devoteesurrenders in full knowledge (cf. Bhagavad-gita 7.17 and 11.40).\nTEXT 20\nkamais tais tair hrta-jnanah\nprapadyante 'nya-devatahtam tam niyamam asthayaprakrtya niyatah svaya\nSYNONYMSkamaih--by desires; taih--by those; taih--by those; hrta--distorted;\njnanah--knowledge; prapadyante--surrender; anya--other; devatah--demigods; tam--that; tam--that; niyamam--rules; asthaya--following;prakrtya--by nature; niyatah--controlled; svaya--by their own.\nTRANSLATIONThose whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto\ndemigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worshipaccording to their own natures.\nPURPORTThose who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto the\nSupreme Lord and engage in His devotional service. As long as thematerial contamination is not completely washed off, they are by naturenondevotees. But even those who have material desires and who resort tothe Supreme Lord are not so much attracted by external nature; becauseof approaching the right goal, they soon become free from all materiallust. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is recommended that whether one isfree from all material desires, or is full of material desires, ordesires liberation from material contamination, or is a pure devoteeand has no desire for material sense gratification, he should in allcases surrender to Vasudeva and worship Him.It is said in the Bhagavatam that less intelligent people who have losttheir spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediatefulfillment of material desires. Generally, such people do not go tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in particularmodes of nature (ignorance and passion) and therefore worship variousdemigods. Following the rules and regulations of worship, they aresatisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desiresand do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of theSupreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there arerecommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes(e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who arenot devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods arebetter than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows that the SupremeLord Krsna is the master of all. In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 5.142)it is said, ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya: only the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Krsna, is master, and all others are servants.Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of hismaterial needs. He depends on the Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee issatisfied with whatever He gives.\nTEXT 21\nyo yo yam yam tanum bhaktah\nsraddhayarcitum icchatitasya tasyacalam sraddham\ntam eva vidadhamy aham\nSYNONYMSyah--that; yah--that; yam--which; yam--which; tanum--form of the\ndemigods; bhaktah--devotee; sraddhaya--with faith; arcitum--to worship;icchati--desires; tasya--of that; tasya--of that; acalam--steady;sraddham--faith; tam--him; eva--surely; vidadhami--give; aham--I.\nTRANSLATIONI am in everyone's heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to\nworship the demigods, I make his faith steady so that he can devotehimself to some particular deity.\nPURPORTGod has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires\nto have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have suchfacilities from the material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoulin everyone's heart, understands and gives facilities to such persons.As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interferewith their independence, but gives all facilities so that they canfulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the all-powerful Godgives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this materialworld and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. Theanswer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give suchfacilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore Hegives everyone full independence--whatever one likes--but His ultimateinstruction we find in the Bhagavad-gita: man should give up all otherengagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man happy.Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannotworship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow anybenediction without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade ofgrass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to thedemigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wantingsome particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For example,a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a personwanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvati; and aperson wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Uma, the wifeof Lord Siva. In this way there are recommendations in the sastras(Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of differentdemigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy aparticular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strongdesire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and sohe successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of thedevotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type ofdemigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannotinfuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is theSupreme Lord or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts of allliving entities, Krsna gives impetus to man to worship certaindemigods. The demigods are actually different parts of the universalbody of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence. In theVedic literature it is stated: \"The Supreme Personality of Godhead asSupersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod; therefore Hearranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the living\nentity. But both the demigod and the living entity are dependent on the\nsupreme will. They are not independent.\"\nTEXT 22\nsa taya sraddhaya yuktas\ntasyaradhanam ihatelabhate ca tatah kamanmayaiva vihitan hi tan\nSYNONYMSsah--he; taya--with that; sraddhaya--with faith; yuktah--endowed;\ntasya--his; aradhanam--worship; ihate--seeks; labhate--obtains; ca--and; tatah--from which; kaman--desires; maya--by Me; eva--alone;vihitan--regulated; hi--for; tan--those.\nTRANSLATIONEndowed with such a faith, he seeks favors of a particular demigod and\nobtains his desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Mealone.\nPURPORTThe demigods cannot award benedictions to the devotees without the\npermission of the Supreme Lord. The living entity may forget thateverything is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do notforget. So the worship of demigods and achievement of desired resultsare due not to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,by arrangement. The less intelligent living entity does not know this,and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit. Butthe pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the SupremeLord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a puredevotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is madto fulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired bythe living entity and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. Inthe Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that one who worships the SupremeLord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictoryin his desires. Devotional service of the Supreme Lord and the worshipof a demigod cannot be on the same platform because worship of ademigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord iscompletely spiritual.For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, materialdesires are impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore notawarded the material benefits desired by less intelligent livingentities who prefer to worship demigods of the material world ratherthan engage in devotional service of the Supreme Lord.\nTEXT 23\nantavat tu phalam tesam\ntad bhavaty alpa-medhasamdevan deva-yajo yantimad-bhakta yanti mam api\nSYNONYMS\nanta-vat tu--limited and temporary; phalam--fruits; tesam--their; tat--\nthat; bhavati--becomes; alpa-medhasam--of those of small intelligence;devan--demigods' planets; deva-yajah--worshipers of demigods; yanti--achieve; mat--My; bhaktah--devotees; yanti--attain; mam--to Me; api--surely.\nTRANSLATIONMen of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are\nlimited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planetsof the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.\nPURPORTSome commentators on the Gita say that one who worships a demigod can\nreach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that theworshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems wherevarious demigods are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achievesthe sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon.Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he canattain that particular god's planet. It is not that everyone,regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the SupremePersonality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly statedthat the worshipers of the demigods go to different planets in thematerial world, but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly tothe supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different partsof the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achievedby worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are lessintelligent because they don't know to what part of the body food mustbe supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there aremany parts and many ways to supply food. This isn't very sanguine. Cananyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do notknow that these demigods are different parts of the universal body ofthe Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each andevery demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary livingentities are also. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that thebrahmanas are the head of the Supreme Lord, the ksatriyas are the arms,etc., and that all serve different functions. Regardless of thesituation, if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part andparcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he doesnot understand this, he achieves different planets where the demigodsreside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.The results achieved by the demigods' benedictions are perishablebecause within this material world the planets, the demigods and theirworshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in thisverse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable,and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent livingentity. Because the pure devotee engaged in Krsna consciousness indevotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissfulexistence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of thecommon worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme Lord isunlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Thereforethe mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.\nTEXT 24\navyaktam vyaktim apannam\nmanyante mam abuddhayahparam bhavam ajanantomamavyayam anuttamam\nSYNONYMSavyaktam--nonmanifested; vyaktim--personality; apannam--achieved;\nmanyante--think; mam--unto Me; abuddhayah--less intelligent persons;param--supreme; bhavam--state of being; ajanantah--without knowing;mama--My; avyayam--imperishable; anuttamam--the finest.\nTRANSLATIONUnintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form\nand personality.

Lord Krsna in His personal form is here speaking beforeArjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that theSupreme Lord ultimately has no form. Yamunacarya, a great devotee ofthe Lord in the disciplic succession from Ramanujacarya, has writtentwo very appropriate verses in this connection. He says,\"My dear Lord, devotees like Vyasadeva and Narada know You to be thePersonality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures,one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Youractivities, and one can thus understand that You are the SupremePersonality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion andignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They areunable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be indiscussing Vedanta and the Upanisads and other Vedic literatures, it isnot possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.\"(Stotra-ratna 12)In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the Personality of Godheadcannot be understood simply by study of the Vedanta literature. Only bythe mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme beknown. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only arethe worshipers of the demigods less intelligent, but those nondevoteeswho are engaged in Vedanta and speculation on Vedic literature withoutany tinge of true Krsna consciousness are also less intelligent, andfor them it is not possible to understand God's personal nature.Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth isimpersonal are described as abuddhayah, which means one who does notknow the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from theimpersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul--but theultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead.Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not evenfollow their great predecessor, Sankaracarya, who has specificallystated that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think Krsnato be only the son of Devaki and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerfulliving entity. This is also condemned in the Bhagavad-gita (9.11).\nAvajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam: \"Only the fools regard Me\nas an ordinary person.\"The fact is that no one can understand Krsna without renderingdevotional service and without developing Krsna consciousness. The Gitaconfirms this.One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, or Hisform, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussingVedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. Whenone is fully engaged in Krsna consciousness, beginning by chanting themaha-mantra--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama,Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare--then only can one understand theSupreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think thatKrsna has a body made of this material nature and that all Hisactivities, His form and everything, are maya. These impersonalists areknown as Mayavadis. They do not know the ultimate truth.The twentieth verse clearly states, kamais tais tair hrta-jnanahprapadyante 'nya-devatah. \"Those who are blinded by lusty desiressurrender unto the different demigods.\" It is accepted that besides theSupreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have theirdifferent planets, and the Lord also has a planet. As stated in thetwenty-third verse, devan deva-yajo yanti mad-bhakta yanti mam api: theworshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods,and those who are devotees of Lord Krsna go to the Krsnaloka planet.Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists stillmaintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms areimpositions. From the study of the Gita does it appear that thedemigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigodsnor Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They areall persons; Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Hehas His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless andthat form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here thatit is not imposed. From the Gita we can clearly understand that theforms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord aresimultaneously existing and that Lord Krsna is sac-cid-ananda, eternalblissful knowledge. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme AbsoluteTruth is ananda-mayo, or by nature full of blissful pleasure, and thatHe is abhyasat, by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspiciousqualities. And in the Gita the Lord says that although He is aja(unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we shouldunderstand from the Bhagavad-gita. We cannot understand how the SupremePersonality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of theimpersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the Gita areconcerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, LordKrsna, has both form and personality.\nTEXT 25\nnaham prakasah sarvasya\nyoga-maya-samavrtahmudho 'yam nabhijanatiloko mam ajam avyayam\nSYNONYMSna--nor; aham--I; prakasah--manifest; sarvasya--to everyone; yoga-maya-\n-internal potency; samavrtah--covered; mudhah--foolish; ayam--this; na-\n-not; abhijanati--can understand; lokah--such less intelligent persons;\nmam--Me; ajam--unborn; avyayam--inexhaustible.\nTRANSLATIONI am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent.

Butactually He was not manifest to everyone. When Krsna was present therewere only a few people who could understand Him to be the SupremePersonality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when Sisupala spokeagainst Krsna being elected president of the assembly, Bhisma supportedHim and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the Pandavasand a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He wasnot revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore in theGita Krsna says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him tobe like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as thereservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees,He was covered by His internal potency.In the prayers of Kunti in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.8.19) it is saidthat the Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-maya and thus ordinarypeople cannot understand Him. This yoga-maya curtain is also confirmedin the Isopanisad (mantra 15), in which the devotee prays:\"O my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, anddevotional service to You is the highest religious principle.Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendentalform is covered by the yoga-maya. The brahmajyoti is the covering ofthe internal potency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgencethat impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, Your eternal formof bliss and knowledge.\"This yoga-maya curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter ofthe Gita. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental formof bliss and knowledge is covered by the internal potency of thebrahmajyoti, and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see theSupreme on this account. Also in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.7) thereis this prayer by Brahma: \"O Supreme Personality of Godhead, OSupersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency andpastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your internal potency,and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learnedscholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world oreven the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energyand potency, although You are present before them.\" The SupremePersonality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, is not only unborn but also avyaya,inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and Hisenergies are all inexhaustible.\nTEXT 26\nvedaham samatitani\nvartamanani carjunabhavisyani ca bhutanimam tu veda na kascana\nSYNONYMS\nveda--know; aham--I; sama--equally; a titani--past; vartamanani--\npresent; ca--and; arjuna--O Arjuna; bhavisyani--future; ca--also;bhutani--living entities; mam--Me; tu--but; veda--knows; na--not;kascana--anyone.\nTRANSLATIONO Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that\nhas happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and allthings that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me noone knows.\nPURPORTHere the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated.\nIf Krsna, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is consideredby the impersonalists to be maya, to be material, then He would, likethe living entity, change His body and forget everything in His pastlife. Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, norcan he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of hispresent life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past,present and future. Unless one is liberated from materialcontamination, he cannot know past, present and future.Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord Krsna clearly says that Hecompletely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in thepresent, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter wehave seen that Lord Krsna remembers instructing Vivasvan, the sun-god,millions of years ago. Krsna knows every living entity because He issituated in every living being's heart as the Supreme Soul. But despiteHis presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presencebeyond the material sky, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, theless intelligent cannot realize Him as the Supreme Person. Certainlythe transcendental body of Sri Krsna is not perishable. He is just likethe sun, and maya is like the cloud. In the material world we can seethat there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars andplanets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, butthis covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon andstars are not actually covered. Similarly, maya cannot cover theSupreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the lessintelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of thischapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to becomeperfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousandsof such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord Krsna is.Even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal Brahman orlocalized Paramatma, he cannot possibly understand the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, without being in Krsnaconsciousness.\nTEXT 27\niccha-dvesa-samutthena\ndvandva-mohena bharatasarva-bhutani sammohamsarge yanti parantapa\nSYNONYMS\niccha--desire; dvesa--hate; samutthena--born; dvandva--duality; mohena-\n-overcome; bharata--O scion of Bharata; sarva--all; bhutani--livingentities; sammoham--into delusion; sarge--in creation; yanti--go;parantapa--O conqueror of enemies.\nTRANSLATIONO scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living\nentities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desireand hate.\nPURPORTThe real constitutional position of the living entity is that of\nsubordination to the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one isdeluded into separation from this pure knowledge, he becomes controlledby illusory energy and cannot understand the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. The illusory energy is manifested in the duality of desire andhate. Due to desire and hate, the ignorant person wants to become onewith the Supreme Lord and envies Krsna as the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Pure devotees, who are not so deluded or contaminated bydesire and hate, can understand that Lord Sri Krsna appears by Hisinternal potencies, but those who are deluded by duality and nesciencethink that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is created by materialenergies. This is their misfortune. Such deluded persons,symptomatically, dwell in dualities of dishonor and honor, misery andhappiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure and pain, etc.,thinking, \"This is my wife; this is my house; I am the master of thishouse; I am the husband of this wife.\" These are the dualities ofdelusion. Those who are so deluded by dualities are completely foolishand therefore cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nTEXT 28\nyesam tv anta-gatam papam\njananam punya-karmanamte dvandva-moha-nirmuktabhajante mam drdha-vratah\nSYNONYMSyesam--whose; tu--but; anta-gatam--completely eradicated; papam--sin;\njananam--of the persons; punya--pious; karmanam--previous activities;te--they; dvandva--duality; moha--delusion; nirmuktah--free from;bhajante--worship; mam--Me; drdha-vratah--with determination.\nTRANSLATIONPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life,\nwhose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed fromthe duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service withdetermination.\nPURPORTThose eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are\nmentioned in this verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish\nand deceitful, it is very difficult to transcend the duality of desire\nand hate. Only those who have passed their lives in practicing theregulative principles of religion, who have acted piously and who haveconquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service and graduallyrise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then,gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritualplatform. This elevation is possible in Krsna consciousness in theassociation of pure devotees who can deliver one from delusion.It is stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.2) that if one actuallywants to be liberated he must render service to the devotees (mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh); but one who associates with materialisticpeople is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence (tamo-dvaram yositam sangi-sangam). All the devotees of the Lord traversethis earth just to recover the conditioned souls from their delusion.The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their constitutionalposition as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest violationof God's law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutionalposition, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality orto be fully engaged in His transcendental loving service withdetermination.\nTEXT 29\njara-marana-moksaya\nmam asritya yatanti yete brahma tad viduh krtsnamadhyatmam karma cakhilam\nSYNONYMSjara--old age; marana--death; moksaya--for the purpose of liberation;\nmam--unto Me; asritya--taking shelter of; yatanti--endeavor; ye--allthose; te--such persons; brahma--Brahman; tat--actually that; viduh--they know; krtsnam--everything; adhyatmam--transcendental; karma--fruitive activities; ca--and; akhilam--entirely.\nTRANSLATIONIntelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and\ndeath take refuge in Me in devotional service.

There is no birth, death, old age and disease forthe spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one ofthe associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages ineternal devotional service, is really liberated. Aham brahmasmi: I amspirit. It is said that one should understand that he is Brahman--spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is also in devotionalservice, as described in this verse. The pure devotees aretranscendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they knoweverything about transcendental and material activities.\nFour kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the\ntranscendental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, andby the grace of the Supreme Lord, when they are fully Krsna conscious,they actually enjoy spiritual association with the Supreme Lord. Butthose who are worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord inHis supreme planet. Even the less intelligent Brahman-realized personscannot reach the supreme planet of Krsna known as Goloka Vrndavana.Only persons who perform activities in Krsna consciousness (mamasritya) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they areactually endeavoring to reach the Krsna planet. Such persons have nomisgivings about Krsna, and thus they are factually Brahman.Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or arca of the Lord, orwho are engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation frommaterial bondage, also know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports ofBrahman, adhibhuta, etc., as explained by the Lord in the next chapter.\nTEXT 30\nsadhibhutadhidaivam mam\nsadhiyajnam ca ye viduhprayana-kale 'pi ca mamte vidur yukta-cetasah\nSYNONYMSsa-adhibhuta--the governing principle of the material manifestation;\nadhidaivam--underlying all the demigods; mam--Me; sa-adhiyajnam--sustaining all sacrifices; ca--and; ye--those; viduh--know; prayana--ofdeath; kale--at the time; api--even; ca--and; mam--Me; te--they; viduh--know; yukta-cetasah--with steadfast minds.\nTRANSLATIONThose who know Me as the Supreme Lord, as the governing principle of\nthe material manifestation, who know Me as the one underlying all thedemigods and as the one sustaining all sacrifices, can, with steadfastmind, understand and know Me, even at the time of death.\nPURPORTPersons acting in Krsna consciousness are never entirely deviated from\nthe path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In thetranscendental association of Krsna consciousness, one can understandhow the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the materialmanifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by suchtranscendental association, one becomes convinced of the SupremePersonality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a Krsnaconscious person can never forget Krsna. Naturally he is thus promotedto the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Vrndavana.This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fullyKrsna conscious person. The beginning of Krsna consciousness isassociation of persons who are in Krsna consciousness. Such associationis spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and,by His grace, one can understand Krsna to be the Supreme God. At thesame time one can really understand the constitutional position of theliving entity and how the living entity forgets Krsna and becomesentangled in material activities. By gradual development of Krsnaconsciousness in good association, the living entity can understand\nthat due to forgetfulness of Krsna he has become conditioned by the\nlaws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form oflife is an opportunity to regain Krsna consciousness and that it shouldbe fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress,the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledgeof Brahman, knowledge of Paramatma, liberation from birth, death anddiseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actuallyelevated in Krsna consciousness does not care for the differentprocesses. He simply directly engages himself in activities of Krsnaconsciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional positionas an eternal servitor of Lord Krsna. In such a situation he takespleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotionalservice. He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will befulfilled. This determined faith is called drdha-vrata, and that is thebeginning of bhakti-yoga or transcendental loving service. That is theverdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the Gita is thesubstance of that conviction.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the\nSrimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute."

That is the vision of a true devotee.Sri Nityananda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divinemaster, delivered the typical naradhamas, the brothers Jagai andMadhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon thelowest of mankind. So the naradhama who is condemned by the Personalityof Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by themercy of a devotee.Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in propagating the bhagavata-dharma oractivities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissivelyhear the message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of thismessage is Bhagavad-gita. The lowest amongst human beings can bedelivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunatelythey even deny giving an aural reception to these messages, and what tospeak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Naradhamas, orthe lowest of mankind, will fully neglect the prime duty of the humanbeing.(3) The next class of duskrti is called mayayapahrta-jnanah, or thosepersons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence ofillusory material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows--greatphilosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc.--but the illusoryenergy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.There are a great number of mayayapahrta-jnanah at the present moment,even amongst the scholars of the Gita. In the Gita, in plain and simplelanguage, it is stated that Sri Krsna is the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned asthe father of Brahma, the original father of all human beings. In fact,Sri Krsna is said to be not only the father of Brahma but also thefather of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahmanand Paramatma; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. Heis the fountainhead of everything and everyone is advised to surrenderunto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, themayayapahrta-jnanah deride the personality of the Supreme Lord andconsider Him merely another human being. They do not know that theblessed form of human life is designed after the eternal andtranscendental feature of the Supreme Lord.All the unauthorized interpretations of the Gita by the class ofmayayapahrta-jnanah, outside the purview of the parampara system, areso many stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding. Thedeluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna,nor do they teach others to follow this principle.(4) The last class of duskrti is called asuram bhavam asritah, or thoseof demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them\nargue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world,\nbut they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. Thereare others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, althoughthe opposite is declared in the Gita. Envious of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicitincarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such personswhose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godheadcannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna.Sri Yamunacarya Albandaru of South India said, \"O my Lord! You areunknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles, despite Youruncommon qualities, features, and activities and despite Yourpersonality being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in thequality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famousauthorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendentalscience and situated in the godly qualities.\"Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3)the deluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as abovementioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality ofGodhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice.\nTEXT 16\ncatur-vidha bhajante mam\njanah sukrtino 'rjunaarto jijnasur artharthijnani ca bharatarsabha\nSYNONYMScatuh-vidhah--four kinds of; bhajante--render services; mam--unto Me;\njanah--persons; su-krtinah--those who are pious; arjuna--O Arjuna;artah--the distressed; jijnasuh--the inquisitive; artha-arthi--one whodesires material gain; jnani--one who knows things as they are; ca--also; bharata-rsabha--O great one amongst the descendants of Bharata.\nTRANSLATIONO best among the Bharatas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render\ndevotional service unto Me--the distressed, the desirer of wealth, theinquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.\nPURPORTUnlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles\nof the scriptures, and they are called sukrtinah, or those who obey therules and regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, andare, more or less, devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there arefour classes of men--those who are sometimes distressed, those who arein need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those whoare sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Thesepersons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under differentconditions. These are not pure devotees because they have someaspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Puredevotional service is without aspiration and without desire formaterial profit. The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.11) defines puredevotion thus:\nanyabhilasita-sunyam\njnana-karmady-anavrtam\nanukulyena krsnanu-silanam bhaktir uttama\n\"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord\nKrsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain throughfruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called puredevotional service.\"When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord fordevotional service and are completely purified by the association of apure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreantsare concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult becausetheir lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. Buteven some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a puredevotee, also become pure devotees.Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord inmaterial distress and at that time associate with pure devotees andbecome, in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simplyfrustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees andbecome inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dryphilosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimeswant to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to renderdevotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonalBrahman and the localized Paramatma and come to the personal conceptionof Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On thewhole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge,and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires,and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothingto do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long assuch a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendentalservice to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and theysearch after mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all thisbefore one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.\nTEXT 17\ntesam jnani nitya-yukta\neka-bhaktir visisyatepriyo hi jnanino 'tyarthamaham sa ca mama priyah\nSYNONYMStesam--out of them; jnani--one in full knowledge; nitya-yuktah--always\nengaged; eka--only one; bhaktih--in devotional service; visisyate--especially; priyah--very dear; hi--certainly; jnaninah--person inknowledge; atyartham--highly; aham--I am; sah--he; ca--also; mama--Mine; priyah--dear.\nTRANSLATIONOf these, the wise one who is in full knowledge in union with Me\nthrough pure devotional service is the best.

And of the four orders, the devotee who is infull knowledge and is at the same time engaged in devotional serviceis, the Lord says, the best. By searching after knowledge one realizesthat his self is different from his material body, and when furtheradvanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman and Paramatma.When one is fully purified, he realizes that his constitutionalposition is to be the eternal servant of God. So by association withpure devotees, the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker aftermaterial amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselvespure. But in the preparatory stage, the man who is in full knowledge ofthe Supreme Lord and is at the same time executing devotional serviceis very dear to the Lord. He who is situated in pure knowledge of thetranscendence of the Supreme Personality of God is so protected indevotional service that material contamination cannot touch him.\nTEXT 18\nudarah sarva evaite\njnani tv atmaiva me matamasthitah sa hi yuktatmamam evanuttamam gatim\nSYNONYMSudarah--magnanimous; sarve--all; eva--certainly; ete--these; jnani--one\nwho is in knowledge; tu--but; atma eva--just like Myself; me--My;matam--opinion; asthitah--situated; sah--he; hi--certainly; yukta-atma--engaged in devotional service; mam--unto Me; eva--certainly;anuttamam--the highest goal; gatim--destination.\nTRANSLATIONAll these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is\nsituated in knowledge of Me I consider verily to dwell in Me.

The Lord says that all are magnanimous becauseanyone who comes to the Lord for any purpose is called a mahatma orgreat soul. The devotees who want some benefit out of devotionalservice are accepted by the Lord because there is an exchange ofaffection. Out of affection they ask the Lord for some materialbenefit, and when they get it they become so satisfied that they alsoadvance in devotional service. But the devotee in full knowledge isconsidered to be very dear to the Lord because his only purpose is toserve the Supreme Lord with love and devotion. Such a devotee cannotlive a second without contacting or serving the Supreme Lord.Similarly, the Supreme Lord is very fond of His devotee and cannot beseparated from him.In the Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.4.68), the Lord says:\nsadhavo hrdayam mahyam\nsadhunam hrdayam tv aham\nmad-anyat te na janantinaham tebhyo manag api\n\"The devotees are always in My heart, and I am always in the hearts of\nthe devotees.

In the beginning ofspiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one's attachmentto materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but whenone is further advanced he can understand that there are activities inthe spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotionalservice. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personalityof Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understandthat Lord Sri Krsna's mercy is everything, that He is the cause of allcauses and that this material manifestation is not independent fromHim. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection ofspiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is arelationship with the Supreme Lord Krsna. Thus he thinks of everythingin relation to Vasudeva, or Sri Krsna. Such a universal vision ofVasudeva precipitates one's full surrender to the Supreme Lord SriKrsna as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter (verses 14 and15) of the Svetasvatara Upanisad: \"In this body there are powers ofspeaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental activities, etc. But theseare not important if not related to the Supreme Lord and becauseVasudeva is all-pervading and everything is Vasudeva, the devoteesurrenders in full knowledge (cf. Bhagavad-gita 7.17 and 11.40).\nTEXT 20\nkamais tais tair hrta-jnanah\nprapadyante 'nya-devatahtam tam niyamam asthayaprakrtya niyatah svaya\nSYNONYMSkamaih--by desires; taih--by those; taih--by those; hrta--distorted;\njnanah--knowledge; prapadyante--surrender; anya--other; devatah--demigods; tam--that; tam--that; niyamam--rules; asthaya--following;prakrtya--by nature; niyatah--controlled; svaya--by their own.\nTRANSLATIONThose whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto\ndemigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worshipaccording to their own natures.\nPURPORTThose who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto the\nSupreme Lord and engage in His devotional service. As long as thematerial contamination is not completely washed off, they are by naturenondevotees. But even those who have material desires and who resort tothe Supreme Lord are not so much attracted by external nature; becauseof approaching the right goal, they soon become free from all materiallust. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is recommended that whether one isfree from all material desires, or is full of material desires, ordesires liberation from material contamination, or is a pure devoteeand has no desire for material sense gratification, he should in allcases surrender to Vasudeva and worship Him.It is said in the Bhagavatam that less intelligent people who have losttheir spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediatefulfillment of material desires. Generally, such people do not go tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in particularmodes of nature (ignorance and passion) and therefore worship variousdemigods. Following the rules and regulations of worship, they aresatisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desiresand do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of theSupreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there arerecommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes(e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who arenot devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods arebetter than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows that the SupremeLord Krsna is the master of all. In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 5.142)it is said, ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya: only the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Krsna, is master, and all others are servants.Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of hismaterial needs. He depends on the Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee issatisfied with whatever He gives.\nTEXT 21\nyo yo yam yam tanum bhaktah\nsraddhayarcitum icchatitasya tasyacalam sraddham\ntam eva vidadhamy aham\nSYNONYMSyah--that; yah--that; yam--which; yam--which; tanum--form of the\ndemigods; bhaktah--devotee; sraddhaya--with faith; arcitum--to worship;icchati--desires; tasya--of that; tasya--of that; acalam--steady;sraddham--faith; tam--him; eva--surely; vidadhami--give; aham--I.\nTRANSLATIONI am in everyone's heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to\nworship the demigods, I make his faith steady so that he can devotehimself to some particular deity.\nPURPORTGod has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires\nto have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have suchfacilities from the material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoulin everyone's heart, understands and gives facilities to such persons.As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interferewith their independence, but gives all facilities so that they canfulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the all-powerful Godgives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this materialworld and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. Theanswer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give suchfacilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore Hegives everyone full independence--whatever one likes--but His ultimateinstruction we find in the Bhagavad-gita: man should give up all otherengagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man happy.Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannotworship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow anybenediction without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade ofgrass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to thedemigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wantingsome particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For example,a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a personwanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvati; and aperson wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Uma, the wifeof Lord Siva. In this way there are recommendations in the sastras(Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of differentdemigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy aparticular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strongdesire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and sohe successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of thedevotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type ofdemigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannotinfuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is theSupreme Lord or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts of allliving entities, Krsna gives impetus to man to worship certaindemigods. The demigods are actually different parts of the universalbody of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence. In theVedic literature it is stated: \"The Supreme Personality of Godhead asSupersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod; therefore Hearranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the living\nentity. But both the demigod and the living entity are dependent on the\nsupreme will. They are not independent.\"\nTEXT 22\nsa taya sraddhaya yuktas\ntasyaradhanam ihatelabhate ca tatah kamanmayaiva vihitan hi tan\nSYNONYMSsah--he; taya--with that; sraddhaya--with faith; yuktah--endowed;\ntasya--his; aradhanam--worship; ihate--seeks; labhate--obtains; ca--and; tatah--from which; kaman--desires; maya--by Me; eva--alone;vihitan--regulated; hi--for; tan--those.\nTRANSLATIONEndowed with such a faith, he seeks favors of a particular demigod and\nobtains his desires.

The living entity may forget thateverything is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do notforget. So the worship of demigods and achievement of desired resultsare due not to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,by arrangement. The less intelligent living entity does not know this,and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit. Butthe pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the SupremeLord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a puredevotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is madto fulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired bythe living entity and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. Inthe Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that one who worships the SupremeLord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictoryin his desires. Devotional service of the Supreme Lord and the worshipof a demigod cannot be on the same platform because worship of ademigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord iscompletely spiritual.For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, materialdesires are impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore notawarded the material benefits desired by less intelligent livingentities who prefer to worship demigods of the material world ratherthan engage in devotional service of the Supreme Lord.\nTEXT 23\nantavat tu phalam tesam\ntad bhavaty alpa-medhasamdevan deva-yajo yantimad-bhakta yanti mam api\nSYNONYMS\nanta-vat tu--limited and temporary; phalam--fruits; tesam--their; tat--\nthat; bhavati--becomes; alpa-medhasam--of those of small intelligence;devan--demigods' planets; deva-yajah--worshipers of demigods; yanti--achieve; mat--My; bhaktah--devotees; yanti--attain; mam--to Me; api--surely.\nTRANSLATIONMen of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are\nlimited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planetsof the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.\nPURPORTSome commentators on the Gita say that one who worships a demigod can\nreach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that theworshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems wherevarious demigods are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achievesthe sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon.Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he canattain that particular god's planet. It is not that everyone,regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the SupremePersonality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly statedthat the worshipers of the demigods go to different planets in thematerial world, but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly tothe supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different partsof the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achievedby worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are lessintelligent because they don't know to what part of the body food mustbe supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there aremany parts and many ways to supply food. This isn't very sanguine. Cananyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do notknow that these demigods are different parts of the universal body ofthe Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each andevery demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary livingentities are also. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that thebrahmanas are the head of the Supreme Lord, the ksatriyas are the arms,etc., and that all serve different functions. Regardless of thesituation, if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part andparcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he doesnot understand this, he achieves different planets where the demigodsreside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.The results achieved by the demigods' benedictions are perishablebecause within this material world the planets, the demigods and theirworshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in thisverse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable,and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent livingentity. Because the pure devotee engaged in Krsna consciousness indevotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissfulexistence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of thecommon worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme Lord isunlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Thereforethe mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.\nTEXT 24\navyaktam vyaktim apannam\nmanyante mam abuddhayahparam bhavam ajanantomamavyayam anuttamam\nSYNONYMSavyaktam--nonmanifested; vyaktim--personality; apannam--achieved;\nmanyante--think; mam--unto Me; abuddhayah--less intelligent persons;param--supreme; bhavam--state of being; ajanantah--without knowing;mama--My; avyayam--imperishable; anuttamam--the finest.\nTRANSLATIONUnintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form\nand personality.

Lord Krsna in His personal form is here speaking beforeArjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that theSupreme Lord ultimately has no form. Yamunacarya, a great devotee ofthe Lord in the disciplic succession from Ramanujacarya, has writtentwo very appropriate verses in this connection. He says,\"My dear Lord, devotees like Vyasadeva and Narada know You to be thePersonality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures,one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Youractivities, and one can thus understand that You are the SupremePersonality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion andignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They areunable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be indiscussing Vedanta and the Upanisads and other Vedic literatures, it isnot possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.\"(Stotra-ratna 12)In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the Personality of Godheadcannot be understood simply by study of the Vedanta literature. Only bythe mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme beknown. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only arethe worshipers of the demigods less intelligent, but those nondevoteeswho are engaged in Vedanta and speculation on Vedic literature withoutany tinge of true Krsna consciousness are also less intelligent, andfor them it is not possible to understand God's personal nature.Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth isimpersonal are described as abuddhayah, which means one who does notknow the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from theimpersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul--but theultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead.Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not evenfollow their great predecessor, Sankaracarya, who has specificallystated that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think Krsnato be only the son of Devaki and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerfulliving entity. This is also condemned in the Bhagavad-gita (9.11).\nAvajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam: \"Only the fools regard Me\nas an ordinary person.\"The fact is that no one can understand Krsna without renderingdevotional service and without developing Krsna consciousness. The Gitaconfirms this.One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, or Hisform, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussingVedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. Whenone is fully engaged in Krsna consciousness, beginning by chanting themaha-mantra--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama,Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare--then only can one understand theSupreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think thatKrsna has a body made of this material nature and that all Hisactivities, His form and everything, are maya. These impersonalists areknown as Mayavadis. They do not know the ultimate truth.The twentieth verse clearly states, kamais tais tair hrta-jnanahprapadyante 'nya-devatah. \"Those who are blinded by lusty desiressurrender unto the different demigods.\" It is accepted that besides theSupreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have theirdifferent planets, and the Lord also has a planet. As stated in thetwenty-third verse, devan deva-yajo yanti mad-bhakta yanti mam api: theworshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods,and those who are devotees of Lord Krsna go to the Krsnaloka planet.Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists stillmaintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms areimpositions. From the study of the Gita does it appear that thedemigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigodsnor Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They areall persons; Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Hehas His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless andthat form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here thatit is not imposed. From the Gita we can clearly understand that theforms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord aresimultaneously existing and that Lord Krsna is sac-cid-ananda, eternalblissful knowledge. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme AbsoluteTruth is ananda-mayo, or by nature full of blissful pleasure, and thatHe is abhyasat, by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspiciousqualities. And in the Gita the Lord says that although He is aja(unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we shouldunderstand from the Bhagavad-gita. We cannot understand how the SupremePersonality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of theimpersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the Gita areconcerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, LordKrsna, has both form and personality.\nTEXT 25\nnaham prakasah sarvasya\nyoga-maya-samavrtahmudho 'yam nabhijanatiloko mam ajam avyayam\nSYNONYMSna--nor; aham--I; prakasah--manifest; sarvasya--to everyone; yoga-maya-\n-internal potency; samavrtah--covered; mudhah--foolish; ayam--this; na-\n-not; abhijanati--can understand; lokah--such less intelligent persons;\nmam--Me; ajam--unborn; avyayam--inexhaustible.\nTRANSLATIONI am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent.

Butactually He was not manifest to everyone. When Krsna was present therewere only a few people who could understand Him to be the SupremePersonality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when Sisupala spokeagainst Krsna being elected president of the assembly, Bhisma supportedHim and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the Pandavasand a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He wasnot revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore in theGita Krsna says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him tobe like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as thereservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees,He was covered by His internal potency.In the prayers of Kunti in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.8.19) it is saidthat the Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-maya and thus ordinarypeople cannot understand Him. This yoga-maya curtain is also confirmedin the Isopanisad (mantra 15), in which the devotee prays:\"O my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, anddevotional service to You is the highest religious principle.Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendentalform is covered by the yoga-maya. The brahmajyoti is the covering ofthe internal potency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgencethat impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, Your eternal formof bliss and knowledge.\"This yoga-maya curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter ofthe Gita. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental formof bliss and knowledge is covered by the internal potency of thebrahmajyoti, and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see theSupreme on this account. Also in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.7) thereis this prayer by Brahma: \"O Supreme Personality of Godhead, OSupersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency andpastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your internal potency,and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learnedscholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world oreven the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energyand potency, although You are present before them.\" The SupremePersonality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, is not only unborn but also avyaya,inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and Hisenergies are all inexhaustible.\nTEXT 26\nvedaham samatitani\nvartamanani carjunabhavisyani ca bhutanimam tu veda na kascana\nSYNONYMS\nveda--know; aham--I; sama--equally; a titani--past; vartamanani--\npresent; ca--and; arjuna--O Arjuna; bhavisyani--future; ca--also;bhutani--living entities; mam--Me; tu--but; veda--knows; na--not;kascana--anyone.\nTRANSLATIONO Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that\nhas happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and allthings that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me noone knows.\nPURPORTHere the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated.\nIf Krsna, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is consideredby the impersonalists to be maya, to be material, then He would, likethe living entity, change His body and forget everything in His pastlife. Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, norcan he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of hispresent life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past,present and future. Unless one is liberated from materialcontamination, he cannot know past, present and future.Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord Krsna clearly says that Hecompletely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in thepresent, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter wehave seen that Lord Krsna remembers instructing Vivasvan, the sun-god,millions of years ago. Krsna knows every living entity because He issituated in every living being's heart as the Supreme Soul. But despiteHis presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presencebeyond the material sky, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, theless intelligent cannot realize Him as the Supreme Person. Certainlythe transcendental body of Sri Krsna is not perishable. He is just likethe sun, and maya is like the cloud. In the material world we can seethat there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars andplanets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, butthis covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon andstars are not actually covered. Similarly, maya cannot cover theSupreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the lessintelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of thischapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to becomeperfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousandsof such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord Krsna is.Even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal Brahman orlocalized Paramatma, he cannot possibly understand the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, without being in Krsnaconsciousness.\nTEXT 27\niccha-dvesa-samutthena\ndvandva-mohena bharatasarva-bhutani sammohamsarge yanti parantapa\nSYNONYMS\niccha--desire; dvesa--hate; samutthena--born; dvandva--duality; mohena-\n-overcome; bharata--O scion of Bharata; sarva--all; bhutani--livingentities; sammoham--into delusion; sarge--in creation; yanti--go;parantapa--O conqueror of enemies.\nTRANSLATIONO scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living\nentities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desireand hate.\nPURPORTThe real constitutional position of the living entity is that of\nsubordination to the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one isdeluded into separation from this pure knowledge, he becomes controlledby illusory energy and cannot understand the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. The illusory energy is manifested in the duality of desire andhate. Due to desire and hate, the ignorant person wants to become onewith the Supreme Lord and envies Krsna as the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Pure devotees, who are not so deluded or contaminated bydesire and hate, can understand that Lord Sri Krsna appears by Hisinternal potencies, but those who are deluded by duality and nesciencethink that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is created by materialenergies. This is their misfortune. Such deluded persons,symptomatically, dwell in dualities of dishonor and honor, misery andhappiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure and pain, etc.,thinking, \"This is my wife; this is my house; I am the master of thishouse; I am the husband of this wife.\" These are the dualities ofdelusion. Those who are so deluded by dualities are completely foolishand therefore cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nTEXT 28\nyesam tv anta-gatam papam\njananam punya-karmanamte dvandva-moha-nirmuktabhajante mam drdha-vratah\nSYNONYMSyesam--whose; tu--but; anta-gatam--completely eradicated; papam--sin;\njananam--of the persons; punya--pious; karmanam--previous activities;te--they; dvandva--duality; moha--delusion; nirmuktah--free from;bhajante--worship; mam--Me; drdha-vratah--with determination.\nTRANSLATIONPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life,\nwhose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed fromthe duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service withdetermination.\nPURPORTThose eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are\nmentioned in this verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish\nand deceitful, it is very difficult to transcend the duality of desire\nand hate. Only those who have passed their lives in practicing theregulative principles of religion, who have acted piously and who haveconquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service and graduallyrise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then,gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritualplatform. This elevation is possible in Krsna consciousness in theassociation of pure devotees who can deliver one from delusion.It is stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.2) that if one actuallywants to be liberated he must render service to the devotees (mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh); but one who associates with materialisticpeople is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence (tamo-dvaram yositam sangi-sangam). All the devotees of the Lord traversethis earth just to recover the conditioned souls from their delusion.The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their constitutionalposition as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest violationof God's law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutionalposition, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality orto be fully engaged in His transcendental loving service withdetermination.\nTEXT 29\njara-marana-moksaya\nmam asritya yatanti yete brahma tad viduh krtsnamadhyatmam karma cakhilam\nSYNONYMSjara--old age; marana--death; moksaya--for the purpose of liberation;\nmam--unto Me; asritya--taking shelter of; yatanti--endeavor; ye--allthose; te--such persons; brahma--Brahman; tat--actually that; viduh--they know; krtsnam--everything; adhyatmam--transcendental; karma--fruitive activities; ca--and; akhilam--entirely.\nTRANSLATIONIntelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and\ndeath take refuge in Me in devotional service.

There is no birth, death, old age and disease forthe spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one ofthe associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages ineternal devotional service, is really liberated. Aham brahmasmi: I amspirit. It is said that one should understand that he is Brahman--spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is also in devotionalservice, as described in this verse. The pure devotees aretranscendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they knoweverything about transcendental and material activities.\nFour kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the\ntranscendental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, andby the grace of the Supreme Lord, when they are fully Krsna conscious,they actually enjoy spiritual association with the Supreme Lord. Butthose who are worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord inHis supreme planet. Even the less intelligent Brahman-realized personscannot reach the supreme planet of Krsna known as Goloka Vrndavana.Only persons who perform activities in Krsna consciousness (mamasritya) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they areactually endeavoring to reach the Krsna planet. Such persons have nomisgivings about Krsna, and thus they are factually Brahman.Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or arca of the Lord, orwho are engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation frommaterial bondage, also know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports ofBrahman, adhibhuta, etc., as explained by the Lord in the next chapter.\nTEXT 30\nsadhibhutadhidaivam mam\nsadhiyajnam ca ye viduhprayana-kale 'pi ca mamte vidur yukta-cetasah\nSYNONYMSsa-adhibhuta--the governing principle of the material manifestation;\nadhidaivam--underlying all the demigods; mam--Me; sa-adhiyajnam--sustaining all sacrifices; ca--and; ye--those; viduh--know; prayana--ofdeath; kale--at the time; api--even; ca--and; mam--Me; te--they; viduh--know; yukta-cetasah--with steadfast minds.\nTRANSLATIONThose who know Me as the Supreme Lord, as the governing principle of\nthe material manifestation, who know Me as the one underlying all thedemigods and as the one sustaining all sacrifices, can, with steadfastmind, understand and know Me, even at the time of death.\nPURPORTPersons acting in Krsna consciousness are never entirely deviated from\nthe path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In thetranscendental association of Krsna consciousness, one can understandhow the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the materialmanifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by suchtranscendental association, one becomes convinced of the SupremePersonality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a Krsnaconscious person can never forget Krsna. Naturally he is thus promotedto the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Vrndavana.This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fullyKrsna conscious person. The beginning of Krsna consciousness isassociation of persons who are in Krsna consciousness. Such associationis spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and,by His grace, one can understand Krsna to be the Supreme God. At thesame time one can really understand the constitutional position of theliving entity and how the living entity forgets Krsna and becomesentangled in material activities. By gradual development of Krsnaconsciousness in good association, the living entity can understand\nthat due to forgetfulness of Krsna he has become conditioned by the\nlaws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form oflife is an opportunity to regain Krsna consciousness and that it shouldbe fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress,the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledgeof Brahman, knowledge of Paramatma, liberation from birth, death anddiseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actuallyelevated in Krsna consciousness does not care for the differentprocesses. He simply directly engages himself in activities of Krsnaconsciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional positionas an eternal servitor of Lord Krsna. In such a situation he takespleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotionalservice. He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will befulfilled. This determined faith is called drdha-vrata, and that is thebeginning of bhakti-yoga or transcendental loving service. That is theverdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the Gita is thesubstance of that conviction.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the\nSrimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute."

      "example": "percent of the population isnaradhama.When the whole population becomes naradhama, naturally all their so-called education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy ofphysical nature. According to the standard of the Gita, a learned manis he who sees on equal terms the learned brahmana, the dog, the cow,the elephant and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee.Sri Nityananda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divinemaster, delivered the typical naradhamas, the brothers Jagai andMadhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon thelowest of mankind. So the naradhama who is condemned by the Personalityof Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by themercy of a devotee.Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in propagating the bhagavata-dharma oractivities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissivelyhear the message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of thismessage is Bhagavad-gita. The lowest amongst human beings can bedelivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunatelythey even deny giving an aural reception to these messages, and what tospeak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Naradhamas, orthe lowest of mankind, will fully neglect the prime duty of the humanbeing.(3) The next class of duskrti is called mayayapahrta-jnanah, or thosepersons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence ofillusory material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows--greatphilosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc.--but the illusoryenergy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.There are a great number of mayayapahrta-jnanah at the present moment,even amongst the scholars of the Gita. In the Gita, in plain and simplelanguage, it is stated that Sri Krsna is the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned asthe father of Brahma, the original father of all human beings. In fact,Sri Krsna is said to be not only the father of Brahma but also thefather of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahmanand Paramatma; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. Heis the fountainhead of everything and everyone is advised to surrenderunto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, themayayapahrta-jnanah deride the personality of the Supreme Lord andconsider Him merely another human being. They do not know that theblessed form of human life is designed after the eternal andtranscendental feature of the Supreme Lord.All the unauthorized interpretations of the Gita by the class ofmayayapahrta-jnanah, outside the purview of the parampara system, areso many stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding. Thedeluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna,nor do they teach others to follow this principle.(4) The last class of duskrti is called asuram bhavam asritah, or thoseof demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them\nargue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world,\nbut they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. Thereare others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, althoughthe opposite is declared in the Gita. Envious of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicitincarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such personswhose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godheadcannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna.Sri Yamunacarya Albandaru of South India said, \"O my Lord! You areunknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles, despite Youruncommon qualities, features, and activities and despite Yourpersonality being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in thequality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famousauthorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendentalscience and situated in the godly qualities.\"Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3)the deluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as abovementioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality ofGodhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice.\nTEXT 16\ncatur-vidha bhajante mam\njanah sukrtino 'rjunaarto jijnasur artharthijnani ca bharatarsabha\nSYNONYMScatuh-vidhah--four kinds of; bhajante--render services; mam--unto Me;\njanah--persons; su-krtinah--those who are pious; arjuna--O Arjuna;artah--the distressed; jijnasuh--the inquisitive; artha-arthi--one whodesires material gain; jnani--one who knows things as they are; ca--also; bharata-rsabha--O great one amongst the descendants of Bharata.\nTRANSLATIONO best among the Bharatas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render\ndevotional service unto Me--the distressed, the desirer of wealth, theinquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.\nPURPORTUnlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles\nof the scriptures, and they are called sukrtinah, or those who obey therules and regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, andare, more or less, devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there arefour classes of men--those who are sometimes distressed, those who arein need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those whoare sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Thesepersons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under differentconditions. These are not pure devotees because they have someaspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Puredevotional service is without aspiration and without desire formaterial profit. The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.11) defines puredevotion thus:\nanyabhilasita-sunyam\njnana-karmady-anavrtam\nanukulyena krsnanu-silanam bhaktir uttama\n\"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord\nKrsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain throughfruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called puredevotional service.\"When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord fordevotional service and are completely purified by the association of apure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreantsare concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult becausetheir lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. Buteven some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a puredevotee, also become pure devotees.Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord inmaterial distress and at that time associate with pure devotees andbecome, in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simplyfrustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees andbecome inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dryphilosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimeswant to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to renderdevotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonalBrahman and the localized Paramatma and come to the personal conceptionof Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On thewhole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge,and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires,and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothingto do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long assuch a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendentalservice to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and theysearch after mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all thisbefore one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.\nTEXT 17\ntesam jnani nitya-yukta\neka-bhaktir visisyatepriyo hi jnanino 'tyarthamaham sa ca mama priyah\nSYNONYMStesam--out of them; jnani--one in full knowledge; nitya-yuktah--always\nengaged; eka--only one; bhaktih--in devotional service; visisyate--especially; priyah--very dear; hi--certainly; jnaninah--person inknowledge; atyartham--highly; aham--I am; sah--he; ca--also; mama--Mine; priyah--dear.\nTRANSLATIONOf these, the wise one who is in full knowledge in union with Me\nthrough pure devotional service is the best.

But out of them, he who is in knowledge ofthe Absolute Truth and free from all material desires becomes a reallypure devotee of the Lord. And of the four orders, the devotee who is infull knowledge and is at the same time engaged in devotional serviceis, the Lord says, the best. By searching after knowledge one realizesthat his self is different from his material body, and when furtheradvanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman and Paramatma.When one is fully purified, he realizes that his constitutionalposition is to be the eternal servant of God. So by association withpure devotees, the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker aftermaterial amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselvespure. But in the preparatory stage, the man who is in full knowledge ofthe Supreme Lord and is at the same time executing devotional serviceis very dear to the Lord. He who is situated in pure knowledge of thetranscendence of the Supreme Personality of God is so protected indevotional service that material contamination cannot touch him.\nTEXT 18\nudarah sarva evaite\njnani tv atmaiva me matamasthitah sa hi yuktatmamam evanuttamam gatim\nSYNONYMSudarah--magnanimous; sarve--all; eva--certainly; ete--these; jnani--one\nwho is in knowledge; tu--but; atma eva--just like Myself; me--My;matam--opinion; asthitah--situated; sah--he; hi--certainly; yukta-atma--engaged in devotional service; mam--unto Me; eva--certainly;anuttamam--the highest goal; gatim--destination.\nTRANSLATIONAll these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is\nsituated in knowledge of Me I consider verily to dwell in Me.

The Lord says that all are magnanimous becauseanyone who comes to the Lord for any purpose is called a mahatma orgreat soul. The devotees who want some benefit out of devotionalservice are accepted by the Lord because there is an exchange ofaffection. Out of affection they ask the Lord for some materialbenefit, and when they get it they become so satisfied that they alsoadvance in devotional service. But the devotee in full knowledge isconsidered to be very dear to the Lord because his only purpose is toserve the Supreme Lord with love and devotion. Such a devotee cannotlive a second without contacting or serving the Supreme Lord.Similarly, the Supreme Lord is very fond of His devotee and cannot beseparated from him.In the Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.4.68), the Lord says:\nsadhavo hrdayam mahyam\nsadhunam hrdayam tv aham\nmad-anyat te na janantinaham tebhyo manag api\n\"The devotees are always in My heart, and I am always in the hearts of\nthe devotees. The devotee does not know anything beyond Me, and I alsocannot forget the devotee. There is a very intimate relationshipbetween Me and the pure devotees.

Such a great soul is very rare.\nPURPORTThe living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental\nrituals after many, many births, may actually become situated intranscendental pure knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godheadis the ultimate goal of spiritual realization. In the beginning ofspiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one's attachmentto materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but whenone is further advanced he can understand that there are activities inthe spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotionalservice. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personalityof Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understandthat Lord Sri Krsna's mercy is everything, that He is the cause of allcauses and that this material manifestation is not independent fromHim. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection ofspiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is arelationship with the Supreme Lord Krsna. Thus he thinks of everythingin relation to Vasudeva, or Sri Krsna. Such a universal vision ofVasudeva precipitates one's full surrender to the Supreme Lord SriKrsna as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter (verses 14 and15) of the Svetasvatara Upanisad: \"In this body there are powers ofspeaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental activities, etc. But theseare not important if not related to the Supreme Lord and becauseVasudeva is all-pervading and everything is Vasudeva, the devoteesurrenders in full knowledge (cf. Bhagavad-gita 7.17 and 11.40).\nTEXT 20\nkamais tais tair hrta-jnanah\nprapadyante 'nya-devatahtam tam niyamam asthayaprakrtya niyatah svaya\nSYNONYMSkamaih--by desires; taih--by those; taih--by those; hrta--distorted;\njnanah--knowledge; prapadyante--surrender; anya--other; devatah--demigods; tam--that; tam--that; niyamam--rules; asthaya--following;prakrtya--by nature; niyatah--controlled; svaya--by their own.\nTRANSLATIONThose whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto\ndemigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worshipaccording to their own natures.\nPURPORTThose who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto the\nSupreme Lord and engage in His devotional service. As long as thematerial contamination is not completely washed off, they are by naturenondevotees. But even those who have material desires and who resort tothe Supreme Lord are not so much attracted by external nature; becauseof approaching the right goal, they soon become free from all materiallust. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is recommended that whether one isfree from all material desires, or is full of material desires, ordesires liberation from material contamination, or is a pure devoteeand has no desire for material sense gratification, he should in allcases surrender to Vasudeva and worship Him.It is said in the Bhagavatam that less intelligent people who have losttheir spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediatefulfillment of material desires. Generally, such people do not go tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in particularmodes of nature (ignorance and passion) and therefore worship variousdemigods. Following the rules and regulations of worship, they aresatisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desiresand do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of theSupreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there arerecommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes(e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who arenot devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods arebetter than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows that the SupremeLord Krsna is the master of all. In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 5.142)it is said, ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya: only the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Krsna, is master, and all others are servants.Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of hismaterial needs. He depends on the Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee issatisfied with whatever He gives.\nTEXT 21\nyo yo yam yam tanum bhaktah\nsraddhayarcitum icchatitasya tasyacalam sraddham\ntam eva vidadhamy aham\nSYNONYMSyah--that; yah--that; yam--which; yam--which; tanum--form of the\ndemigods; bhaktah--devotee; sraddhaya--with faith; arcitum--to worship;icchati--desires; tasya--of that; tasya--of that; acalam--steady;sraddham--faith; tam--him; eva--surely; vidadhami--give; aham--I.\nTRANSLATIONI am in everyone's heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to\nworship the demigods, I make his faith steady so that he can devotehimself to some particular deity.\nPURPORTGod has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires\nto have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have suchfacilities from the material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoulin everyone's heart, understands and gives facilities to such persons.As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interferewith their independence, but gives all facilities so that they canfulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the all-powerful Godgives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this materialworld and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. Theanswer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give suchfacilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore Hegives everyone full independence--whatever one likes--but His ultimateinstruction we find in the Bhagavad-gita: man should give up all otherengagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man happy.Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannotworship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow anybenediction without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade ofgrass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to thedemigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wantingsome particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For example,a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a personwanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvati; and aperson wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Uma, the wifeof Lord Siva. In this way there are recommendations in the sastras(Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of differentdemigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy aparticular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strongdesire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and sohe successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of thedevotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type ofdemigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannotinfuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is theSupreme Lord or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts of allliving entities, Krsna gives impetus to man to worship certaindemigods. The demigods are actually different parts of the universalbody of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence. In theVedic literature it is stated: \"The Supreme Personality of Godhead asSupersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod; therefore Hearranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the living\nentity. But both the demigod and the living entity are dependent on the\nsupreme will. They are not independent.\"\nTEXT 22\nsa taya sraddhaya yuktas\ntasyaradhanam ihatelabhate ca tatah kamanmayaiva vihitan hi tan\nSYNONYMSsah--he; taya--with that; sraddhaya--with faith; yuktah--endowed;\ntasya--his; aradhanam--worship; ihate--seeks; labhate--obtains; ca--and; tatah--from which; kaman--desires; maya--by Me; eva--alone;vihitan--regulated; hi--for; tan--those.\nTRANSLATIONEndowed with such a faith, he seeks favors of a particular demigod and\nobtains his desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Mealone.\nPURPORTThe demigods cannot award benedictions to the devotees without the\npermission of the Supreme Lord. The living entity may forget thateverything is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do notforget. So the worship of demigods and achievement of desired resultsare due not to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,by arrangement. The less intelligent living entity does not know this,and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit. Butthe pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the SupremeLord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a puredevotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is madto fulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired bythe living entity and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. Inthe Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that one who worships the SupremeLord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictoryin his desires. Devotional service of the Supreme Lord and the worshipof a demigod cannot be on the same platform because worship of ademigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord iscompletely spiritual.For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, materialdesires are impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore notawarded the material benefits desired by less intelligent livingentities who prefer to worship demigods of the material world ratherthan engage in devotional service of the Supreme Lord.\nTEXT 23\nantavat tu phalam tesam\ntad bhavaty alpa-medhasamdevan deva-yajo yantimad-bhakta yanti mam api\nSYNONYMS\nanta-vat tu--limited and temporary; phalam--fruits; tesam--their; tat--\nthat; bhavati--becomes; alpa-medhasam--of those of small intelligence;devan--demigods' planets; deva-yajah--worshipers of demigods; yanti--achieve; mat--My; bhaktah--devotees; yanti--attain; mam--to Me; api--surely.\nTRANSLATIONMen of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are\nlimited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planetsof the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.\nPURPORTSome commentators on the Gita say that one who worships a demigod can\nreach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that theworshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems wherevarious demigods are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achievesthe sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon.Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he canattain that particular god's planet. It is not that everyone,regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the SupremePersonality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly statedthat the worshipers of the demigods go to different planets in thematerial world, but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly tothe supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different partsof the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achievedby worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are lessintelligent because they don't know to what part of the body food mustbe supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there aremany parts and many ways to supply food. This isn't very sanguine. Cananyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do notknow that these demigods are different parts of the universal body ofthe Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each andevery demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary livingentities are also. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that thebrahmanas are the head of the Supreme Lord, the ksatriyas are the arms,etc., and that all serve different functions. Regardless of thesituation, if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part andparcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he doesnot understand this, he achieves different planets where the demigodsreside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.The results achieved by the demigods' benedictions are perishablebecause within this material world the planets, the demigods and theirworshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in thisverse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable,and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent livingentity. Because the pure devotee engaged in Krsna consciousness indevotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissfulexistence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of thecommon worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme Lord isunlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Thereforethe mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.\nTEXT 24\navyaktam vyaktim apannam\nmanyante mam abuddhayahparam bhavam ajanantomamavyayam anuttamam\nSYNONYMSavyaktam--nonmanifested; vyaktim--personality; apannam--achieved;\nmanyante--think; mam--unto Me; abuddhayah--less intelligent persons;param--supreme; bhavam--state of being; ajanantah--without knowing;mama--My; avyayam--imperishable; anuttamam--the finest.\nTRANSLATIONUnintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form\nand personality.

Lord Krsna in His personal form is here speaking beforeArjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that theSupreme Lord ultimately has no form. Yamunacarya, a great devotee ofthe Lord in the disciplic succession from Ramanujacarya, has writtentwo very appropriate verses in this connection. He says,\"My dear Lord, devotees like Vyasadeva and Narada know You to be thePersonality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures,one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Youractivities, and one can thus understand that You are the SupremePersonality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion andignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They areunable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be indiscussing Vedanta and the Upanisads and other Vedic literatures, it isnot possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.\"(Stotra-ratna 12)In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the Personality of Godheadcannot be understood simply by study of the Vedanta literature. Only bythe mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme beknown. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only arethe worshipers of the demigods less intelligent, but those nondevoteeswho are engaged in Vedanta and speculation on Vedic literature withoutany tinge of true Krsna consciousness are also less intelligent, andfor them it is not possible to understand God's personal nature.Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth isimpersonal are described as abuddhayah, which means one who does notknow the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from theimpersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul--but theultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead.Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not evenfollow their great predecessor, Sankaracarya, who has specificallystated that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think Krsnato be only the son of Devaki and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerfulliving entity. This is also condemned in the Bhagavad-gita (9.11).\nAvajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam: \"Only the fools regard Me\nas an ordinary person.\"The fact is that no one can understand Krsna without renderingdevotional service and without developing Krsna consciousness. The Gitaconfirms this.One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, or Hisform, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussingVedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. Whenone is fully engaged in Krsna consciousness, beginning by chanting themaha-mantra--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama,Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare--then only can one understand theSupreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think thatKrsna has a body made of this material nature and that all Hisactivities, His form and everything, are maya. These impersonalists areknown as Mayavadis. They do not know the ultimate truth.The twentieth verse clearly states, kamais tais tair hrta-jnanahprapadyante 'nya-devatah. \"Those who are blinded by lusty desiressurrender unto the different demigods.\" It is accepted that besides theSupreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have theirdifferent planets, and the Lord also has a planet. As stated in thetwenty-third verse, devan deva-yajo yanti mad-bhakta yanti mam api: theworshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods,and those who are devotees of Lord Krsna go to the Krsnaloka planet.Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists stillmaintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms areimpositions. From the study of the Gita does it appear that thedemigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigodsnor Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They areall persons; Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Hehas His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless andthat form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here thatit is not imposed. From the Gita we can clearly understand that theforms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord aresimultaneously existing and that Lord Krsna is sac-cid-ananda, eternalblissful knowledge. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme AbsoluteTruth is ananda-mayo, or by nature full of blissful pleasure, and thatHe is abhyasat, by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspiciousqualities. And in the Gita the Lord says that although He is aja(unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we shouldunderstand from the Bhagavad-gita. We cannot understand how the SupremePersonality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of theimpersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the Gita areconcerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, LordKrsna, has both form and personality.\nTEXT 25\nnaham prakasah sarvasya\nyoga-maya-samavrtahmudho 'yam nabhijanatiloko mam ajam avyayam\nSYNONYMSna--nor; aham--I; prakasah--manifest; sarvasya--to everyone; yoga-maya-\n-internal potency; samavrtah--covered; mudhah--foolish; ayam--this; na-\n-not; abhijanati--can understand; lokah--such less intelligent persons;\nmam--Me; ajam--unborn; avyayam--inexhaustible.\nTRANSLATIONI am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent.

Butactually He was not manifest to everyone. When Krsna was present therewere only a few people who could understand Him to be the SupremePersonality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when Sisupala spokeagainst Krsna being elected president of the assembly, Bhisma supportedHim and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the Pandavasand a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He wasnot revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore in theGita Krsna says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him tobe like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as thereservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees,He was covered by His internal potency.In the prayers of Kunti in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.8.19) it is saidthat the Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-maya and thus ordinarypeople cannot understand Him. This yoga-maya curtain is also confirmedin the Isopanisad (mantra 15), in which the devotee prays:\"O my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, anddevotional service to You is the highest religious principle.Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendentalform is covered by the yoga-maya. The brahmajyoti is the covering ofthe internal potency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgencethat impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, Your eternal formof bliss and knowledge.\"This yoga-maya curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter ofthe Gita. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental formof bliss and knowledge is covered by the internal potency of thebrahmajyoti, and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see theSupreme on this account. Also in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.7) thereis this prayer by Brahma: \"O Supreme Personality of Godhead, OSupersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency andpastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your internal potency,and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learnedscholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world oreven the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energyand potency, although You are present before them.\" The SupremePersonality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, is not only unborn but also avyaya,inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and Hisenergies are all inexhaustible.\nTEXT 26\nvedaham samatitani\nvartamanani carjunabhavisyani ca bhutanimam tu veda na kascana\nSYNONYMS\nveda--know; aham--I; sama--equally; a titani--past; vartamanani--\npresent; ca--and; arjuna--O Arjuna; bhavisyani--future; ca--also;bhutani--living entities; mam--Me; tu--but; veda--knows; na--not;kascana--anyone.\nTRANSLATIONO Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that\nhas happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and allthings that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me noone knows.\nPURPORTHere the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated.\nIf Krsna, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is consideredby the impersonalists to be maya, to be material, then He would, likethe living entity, change His body and forget everything in His pastlife. Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, norcan he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of hispresent life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past,present and future. Unless one is liberated from materialcontamination, he cannot know past, present and future.Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord Krsna clearly says that Hecompletely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in thepresent, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter wehave seen that Lord Krsna remembers instructing Vivasvan, the sun-god,millions of years ago. Krsna knows every living entity because He issituated in every living being's heart as the Supreme Soul. But despiteHis presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presencebeyond the material sky, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, theless intelligent cannot realize Him as the Supreme Person. Certainlythe transcendental body of Sri Krsna is not perishable. He is just likethe sun, and maya is like the cloud. In the material world we can seethat there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars andplanets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, butthis covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon andstars are not actually covered. Similarly, maya cannot cover theSupreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the lessintelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of thischapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to becomeperfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousandsof such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord Krsna is.Even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal Brahman orlocalized Paramatma, he cannot possibly understand the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, without being in Krsnaconsciousness.\nTEXT 27\niccha-dvesa-samutthena\ndvandva-mohena bharatasarva-bhutani sammohamsarge yanti parantapa\nSYNONYMS\niccha--desire; dvesa--hate; samutthena--born; dvandva--duality; mohena-\n-overcome; bharata--O scion of Bharata; sarva--all; bhutani--livingentities; sammoham--into delusion; sarge--in creation; yanti--go;parantapa--O conqueror of enemies.\nTRANSLATIONO scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living\nentities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desireand hate.\nPURPORTThe real constitutional position of the living entity is that of\nsubordination to the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one isdeluded into separation from this pure knowledge, he becomes controlledby illusory energy and cannot understand the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. The illusory energy is manifested in the duality of desire andhate. Due to desire and hate, the ignorant person wants to become onewith the Supreme Lord and envies Krsna as the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Pure devotees, who are not so deluded or contaminated bydesire and hate, can understand that Lord Sri Krsna appears by Hisinternal potencies, but those who are deluded by duality and nesciencethink that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is created by materialenergies. This is their misfortune. Such deluded persons,symptomatically, dwell in dualities of dishonor and honor, misery andhappiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure and pain, etc.,thinking, \"This is my wife; this is my house; I am the master of thishouse; I am the husband of this wife.\" These are the dualities ofdelusion. Those who are so deluded by dualities are completely foolishand therefore cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nTEXT 28\nyesam tv anta-gatam papam\njananam punya-karmanamte dvandva-moha-nirmuktabhajante mam drdha-vratah\nSYNONYMSyesam--whose; tu--but; anta-gatam--completely eradicated; papam--sin;\njananam--of the persons; punya--pious; karmanam--previous activities;te--they; dvandva--duality; moha--delusion; nirmuktah--free from;bhajante--worship; mam--Me; drdha-vratah--with determination.\nTRANSLATIONPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life,\nwhose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed fromthe duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service withdetermination.\nPURPORTThose eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are\nmentioned in this verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish\nand deceitful, it is very difficult to transcend the duality of desire\nand hate. Only those who have passed their lives in practicing theregulative principles of religion, who have acted piously and who haveconquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service and graduallyrise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then,gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritualplatform. This elevation is possible in Krsna consciousness in theassociation of pure devotees who can deliver one from delusion.It is stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.2) that if one actuallywants to be liberated he must render service to the devotees (mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh); but one who associates with materialisticpeople is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence (tamo-dvaram yositam sangi-sangam). All the devotees of the Lord traversethis earth just to recover the conditioned souls from their delusion.The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their constitutionalposition as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest violationof God's law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutionalposition, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality orto be fully engaged in His transcendental loving service withdetermination.\nTEXT 29\njara-marana-moksaya\nmam asritya yatanti yete brahma tad viduh krtsnamadhyatmam karma cakhilam\nSYNONYMSjara--old age; marana--death; moksaya--for the purpose of liberation;\nmam--unto Me; asritya--taking shelter of; yatanti--endeavor; ye--allthose; te--such persons; brahma--Brahman; tat--actually that; viduh--they know; krtsnam--everything; adhyatmam--transcendental; karma--fruitive activities; ca--and; akhilam--entirely.\nTRANSLATIONIntelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and\ndeath take refuge in Me in devotional service. They are actuallyBrahman because they entirely know everything about transcendental andfruitive activities.\nPURPORTBirth, death, old age and diseases affect this material body, but not\nthe spiritual body. There is no birth, death, old age and disease forthe spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one ofthe associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages ineternal devotional service, is really liberated. Aham brahmasmi: I amspirit. It is said that one should understand that he is Brahman--spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is also in devotionalservice, as described in this verse. The pure devotees aretranscendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they knoweverything about transcendental and material activities.\nFour kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the\ntranscendental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, andby the grace of the Supreme Lord, when they are fully Krsna conscious,they actually enjoy spiritual association with the Supreme Lord. Butthose who are worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord inHis supreme planet. Even the less intelligent Brahman-realized personscannot reach the supreme planet of Krsna known as Goloka Vrndavana.Only persons who perform activities in Krsna consciousness (mamasritya) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they areactually endeavoring to reach the Krsna planet. Such persons have nomisgivings about Krsna, and thus they are factually Brahman.Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or arca of the Lord, orwho are engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation frommaterial bondage, also know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports ofBrahman, adhibhuta, etc., as explained by the Lord in the next chapter.\nTEXT 30\nsadhibhutadhidaivam mam\nsadhiyajnam ca ye viduhprayana-kale 'pi ca mamte vidur yukta-cetasah\nSYNONYMSsa-adhibhuta--the governing principle of the material manifestation;\nadhidaivam--underlying all the demigods; mam--Me; sa-adhiyajnam--sustaining all sacrifices; ca--and; ye--those; viduh--know; prayana--ofdeath; kale--at the time; api--even; ca--and; mam--Me; te--they; viduh--know; yukta-cetasah--with steadfast minds.\nTRANSLATIONThose who know Me as the Supreme Lord, as the governing principle of\nthe material manifestation, who know Me as the one underlying all thedemigods and as the one sustaining all sacrifices, can, with steadfastmind, understand and know Me, even at the time of death.\nPURPORTPersons acting in Krsna consciousness are never entirely deviated from\nthe path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In thetranscendental association of Krsna consciousness, one can understandhow the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the materialmanifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by suchtranscendental association, one becomes convinced of the SupremePersonality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a Krsnaconscious person can never forget Krsna. Naturally he is thus promotedto the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Vrndavana.This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fullyKrsna conscious person. The beginning of Krsna consciousness isassociation of persons who are in Krsna consciousness. Such associationis spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and,by His grace, one can understand Krsna to be the Supreme God. At thesame time one can really understand the constitutional position of theliving entity and how the living entity forgets Krsna and becomesentangled in material activities. By gradual development of Krsnaconsciousness in good association, the living entity can understand\nthat due to forgetfulness of Krsna he has become conditioned by the\nlaws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form oflife is an opportunity to regain Krsna consciousness and that it shouldbe fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress,the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledgeof Brahman, knowledge of Paramatma, liberation from birth, death anddiseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actuallyelevated in Krsna consciousness does not care for the differentprocesses. He simply directly engages himself in activities of Krsnaconsciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional positionas an eternal servitor of Lord Krsna. In such a situation he takespleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotionalservice. He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will befulfilled. This determined faith is called drdha-vrata, and that is thebeginning of bhakti-yoga or transcendental loving service. That is theverdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the Gita is thesubstance of that conviction.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the\nSrimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute."

According to the standard of the Gita, a learned manis he who sees on equal terms the learned brahmana, the dog, the cow,the elephant and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee.Sri Nityananda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divinemaster, delivered the typical naradhamas, the brothers Jagai andMadhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon thelowest of mankind. So the naradhama who is condemned by the Personalityof Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by themercy of a devotee.Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in propagating the bhagavata-dharma oractivities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissivelyhear the message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of thismessage is Bhagavad-gita. The lowest amongst human beings can bedelivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunatelythey even deny giving an aural reception to these messages, and what tospeak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Naradhamas, orthe lowest of mankind, will fully neglect the prime duty of the humanbeing.(3) The next class of duskrti is called mayayapahrta-jnanah, or thosepersons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence ofillusory material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows--greatphilosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc.--but the illusoryenergy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.There are a great number of mayayapahrta-jnanah at the present moment,even amongst the scholars of the Gita. In the Gita, in plain and simplelanguage, it is stated that Sri Krsna is the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned asthe father of Brahma, the original father of all human beings. In fact,Sri Krsna is said to be not only the father of Brahma but also thefather of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahmanand Paramatma; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. Heis the fountainhead of everything and everyone is advised to surrenderunto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, themayayapahrta-jnanah deride the personality of the Supreme Lord andconsider Him merely another human being. They do not know that theblessed form of human life is designed after the eternal andtranscendental feature of the Supreme Lord.All the unauthorized interpretations of the Gita by the class ofmayayapahrta-jnanah, outside the purview of the parampara system, areso many stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding. Thedeluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna,nor do they teach others to follow this principle.(4) The last class of duskrti is called asuram bhavam asritah, or thoseof demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them\nargue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world,\nbut they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. Thereare others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, althoughthe opposite is declared in the Gita. Envious of the SupremePersonality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicitincarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such personswhose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godheadcannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna.Sri Yamunacarya Albandaru of South India said, \"O my Lord! You areunknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles, despite Youruncommon qualities, features, and activities and despite Yourpersonality being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in thequality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famousauthorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendentalscience and situated in the godly qualities.\"Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3)the deluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as abovementioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality ofGodhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice.\nTEXT 16\ncatur-vidha bhajante mam\njanah sukrtino 'rjunaarto jijnasur artharthijnani ca bharatarsabha\nSYNONYMScatuh-vidhah--four kinds of; bhajante--render services; mam--unto Me;\njanah--persons; su-krtinah--those who are pious; arjuna--O Arjuna;artah--the distressed; jijnasuh--the inquisitive; artha-arthi--one whodesires material gain; jnani--one who knows things as they are; ca--also; bharata-rsabha--O great one amongst the descendants of Bharata.\nTRANSLATIONO best among the Bharatas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render\ndevotional service unto Me--the distressed, the desirer of wealth, theinquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.\nPURPORTUnlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles\nof the scriptures, and they are called sukrtinah, or those who obey therules and regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, andare, more or less, devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there arefour classes of men--those who are sometimes distressed, those who arein need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those whoare sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Thesepersons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under differentconditions. These are not pure devotees because they have someaspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Puredevotional service is without aspiration and without desire formaterial profit. The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.11) defines puredevotion thus:\nanyabhilasita-sunyam\njnana-karmady-anavrtam\nanukulyena krsnanu-silanam bhaktir uttama\n\"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord\nKrsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain throughfruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called puredevotional service.\"When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord fordevotional service and are completely purified by the association of apure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreantsare concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult becausetheir lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. Buteven some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a puredevotee, also become pure devotees.Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord inmaterial distress and at that time associate with pure devotees andbecome, in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simplyfrustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees andbecome inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dryphilosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimeswant to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to renderdevotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonalBrahman and the localized Paramatma and come to the personal conceptionof Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On thewhole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge,and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires,and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothingto do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long assuch a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendentalservice to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and theysearch after mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all thisbefore one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.\nTEXT 17\ntesam jnani nitya-yukta\neka-bhaktir visisyatepriyo hi jnanino 'tyarthamaham sa ca mama priyah\nSYNONYMStesam--out of them; jnani--one in full knowledge; nitya-yuktah--always\nengaged; eka--only one; bhaktih--in devotional service; visisyate--especially; priyah--very dear; hi--certainly; jnaninah--person inknowledge; atyartham--highly; aham--I am; sah--he; ca--also; mama--Mine; priyah--dear.\nTRANSLATIONOf these, the wise one who is in full knowledge in union with Me\nthrough pure devotional service is the best.

But out of them, he who is in knowledge ofthe Absolute Truth and free from all material desires becomes a reallypure devotee of the Lord. And of the four orders, the devotee who is infull knowledge and is at the same time engaged in devotional serviceis, the Lord says, the best. By searching after knowledge one realizesthat his self is different from his material body, and when furtheradvanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman and Paramatma.When one is fully purified, he realizes that his constitutionalposition is to be the eternal servant of God. So by association withpure devotees, the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker aftermaterial amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselvespure. But in the preparatory stage, the man who is in full knowledge ofthe Supreme Lord and is at the same time executing devotional serviceis very dear to the Lord. He who is situated in pure knowledge of thetranscendence of the Supreme Personality of God is so protected indevotional service that material contamination cannot touch him.\nTEXT 18\nudarah sarva evaite\njnani tv atmaiva me matamasthitah sa hi yuktatmamam evanuttamam gatim\nSYNONYMSudarah--magnanimous; sarve--all; eva--certainly; ete--these; jnani--one\nwho is in knowledge; tu--but; atma eva--just like Myself; me--My;matam--opinion; asthitah--situated; sah--he; hi--certainly; yukta-atma--engaged in devotional service; mam--unto Me; eva--certainly;anuttamam--the highest goal; gatim--destination.\nTRANSLATIONAll these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is\nsituated in knowledge of Me I consider verily to dwell in Me.

The Lord says that all are magnanimous becauseanyone who comes to the Lord for any purpose is called a mahatma orgreat soul. The devotees who want some benefit out of devotionalservice are accepted by the Lord because there is an exchange ofaffection. Out of affection they ask the Lord for some materialbenefit, and when they get it they become so satisfied that they alsoadvance in devotional service. But the devotee in full knowledge isconsidered to be very dear to the Lord because his only purpose is toserve the Supreme Lord with love and devotion. Such a devotee cannotlive a second without contacting or serving the Supreme Lord.Similarly, the Supreme Lord is very fond of His devotee and cannot beseparated from him.In the Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.4.68), the Lord says:\nsadhavo hrdayam mahyam\nsadhunam hrdayam tv aham\nmad-anyat te na janantinaham tebhyo manag api\n\"The devotees are always in My heart, and I am always in the hearts of\nthe devotees.

In the beginning ofspiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one's attachmentto materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but whenone is further advanced he can understand that there are activities inthe spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotionalservice. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personalityof Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understandthat Lord Sri Krsna's mercy is everything, that He is the cause of allcauses and that this material manifestation is not independent fromHim. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection ofspiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is arelationship with the Supreme Lord Krsna. Thus he thinks of everythingin relation to Vasudeva, or Sri Krsna. Such a universal vision ofVasudeva precipitates one's full surrender to the Supreme Lord SriKrsna as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter (verses 14 and15) of the Svetasvatara Upanisad: \"In this body there are powers ofspeaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental activities, etc. But theseare not important if not related to the Supreme Lord and becauseVasudeva is all-pervading and everything is Vasudeva, the devoteesurrenders in full knowledge (cf. Bhagavad-gita 7.17 and 11.40).\nTEXT 20\nkamais tais tair hrta-jnanah\nprapadyante 'nya-devatahtam tam niyamam asthayaprakrtya niyatah svaya\nSYNONYMSkamaih--by desires; taih--by those; taih--by those; hrta--distorted;\njnanah--knowledge; prapadyante--surrender; anya--other; devatah--demigods; tam--that; tam--that; niyamam--rules; asthaya--following;prakrtya--by nature; niyatah--controlled; svaya--by their own.\nTRANSLATIONThose whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto\ndemigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worshipaccording to their own natures.\nPURPORTThose who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto the\nSupreme Lord and engage in His devotional service. As long as thematerial contamination is not completely washed off, they are by naturenondevotees. But even those who have material desires and who resort tothe Supreme Lord are not so much attracted by external nature; becauseof approaching the right goal, they soon become free from all materiallust. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is recommended that whether one isfree from all material desires, or is full of material desires, ordesires liberation from material contamination, or is a pure devoteeand has no desire for material sense gratification, he should in allcases surrender to Vasudeva and worship Him.It is said in the Bhagavatam that less intelligent people who have losttheir spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediatefulfillment of material desires. Generally, such people do not go tothe Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in particularmodes of nature (ignorance and passion) and therefore worship variousdemigods. Following the rules and regulations of worship, they aresatisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desiresand do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of theSupreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there arerecommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes(e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who arenot devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods arebetter than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows that the SupremeLord Krsna is the master of all. In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 5.142)it is said, ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya: only the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Krsna, is master, and all others are servants.Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of hismaterial needs. He depends on the Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee issatisfied with whatever He gives.\nTEXT 21\nyo yo yam yam tanum bhaktah\nsraddhayarcitum icchatitasya tasyacalam sraddham\ntam eva vidadhamy aham\nSYNONYMSyah--that; yah--that; yam--which; yam--which; tanum--form of the\ndemigods; bhaktah--devotee; sraddhaya--with faith; arcitum--to worship;icchati--desires; tasya--of that; tasya--of that; acalam--steady;sraddham--faith; tam--him; eva--surely; vidadhami--give; aham--I.\nTRANSLATIONI am in everyone's heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to\nworship the demigods, I make his faith steady so that he can devotehimself to some particular deity.\nPURPORTGod has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires\nto have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have suchfacilities from the material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoulin everyone's heart, understands and gives facilities to such persons.As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interferewith their independence, but gives all facilities so that they canfulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the all-powerful Godgives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this materialworld and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. Theanswer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give suchfacilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore Hegives everyone full independence--whatever one likes--but His ultimateinstruction we find in the Bhagavad-gita: man should give up all otherengagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man happy.Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will ofthe Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannotworship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow anybenediction without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade ofgrass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to thedemigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wantingsome particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For example,a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a personwanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvati; and aperson wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Uma, the wifeof Lord Siva. In this way there are recommendations in the sastras(Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of differentdemigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy aparticular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strongdesire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and sohe successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of thedevotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type ofdemigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannotinfuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is theSupreme Lord or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts of allliving entities, Krsna gives impetus to man to worship certaindemigods. The demigods are actually different parts of the universalbody of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence. In theVedic literature it is stated: \"The Supreme Personality of Godhead asSupersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod; therefore Hearranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the living\nentity. But both the demigod and the living entity are dependent on the\nsupreme will. They are not independent.\"\nTEXT 22\nsa taya sraddhaya yuktas\ntasyaradhanam ihatelabhate ca tatah kamanmayaiva vihitan hi tan\nSYNONYMSsah--he; taya--with that; sraddhaya--with faith; yuktah--endowed;\ntasya--his; aradhanam--worship; ihate--seeks; labhate--obtains; ca--and; tatah--from which; kaman--desires; maya--by Me; eva--alone;vihitan--regulated; hi--for; tan--those.\nTRANSLATIONEndowed with such a faith, he seeks favors of a particular demigod and\nobtains his desires.

The living entity may forget thateverything is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do notforget. So the worship of demigods and achievement of desired resultsare due not to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,by arrangement. The less intelligent living entity does not know this,and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit. Butthe pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the SupremeLord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a puredevotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is madto fulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired bythe living entity and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. Inthe Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that one who worships the SupremeLord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictoryin his desires. Devotional service of the Supreme Lord and the worshipof a demigod cannot be on the same platform because worship of ademigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord iscompletely spiritual.For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, materialdesires are impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore notawarded the material benefits desired by less intelligent livingentities who prefer to worship demigods of the material world ratherthan engage in devotional service of the Supreme Lord.\nTEXT 23\nantavat tu phalam tesam\ntad bhavaty alpa-medhasamdevan deva-yajo yantimad-bhakta yanti mam api\nSYNONYMS\nanta-vat tu--limited and temporary; phalam--fruits; tesam--their; tat--\nthat; bhavati--becomes; alpa-medhasam--of those of small intelligence;devan--demigods' planets; deva-yajah--worshipers of demigods; yanti--achieve; mat--My; bhaktah--devotees; yanti--attain; mam--to Me; api--surely.\nTRANSLATIONMen of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are\nlimited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planetsof the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.\nPURPORTSome commentators on the Gita say that one who worships a demigod can\nreach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that theworshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems wherevarious demigods are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achievesthe sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon.Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he canattain that particular god's planet. It is not that everyone,regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the SupremePersonality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly statedthat the worshipers of the demigods go to different planets in thematerial world, but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly tothe supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different partsof the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achievedby worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are lessintelligent because they don't know to what part of the body food mustbe supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there aremany parts and many ways to supply food. This isn't very sanguine. Cananyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do notknow that these demigods are different parts of the universal body ofthe Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each andevery demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary livingentities are also. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that thebrahmanas are the head of the Supreme Lord, the ksatriyas are the arms,etc., and that all serve different functions. Regardless of thesituation, if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part andparcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he doesnot understand this, he achieves different planets where the demigodsreside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.The results achieved by the demigods' benedictions are perishablebecause within this material world the planets, the demigods and theirworshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in thisverse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable,and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent livingentity. Because the pure devotee engaged in Krsna consciousness indevotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissfulexistence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of thecommon worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme Lord isunlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Thereforethe mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.\nTEXT 24\navyaktam vyaktim apannam\nmanyante mam abuddhayahparam bhavam ajanantomamavyayam anuttamam\nSYNONYMSavyaktam--nonmanifested; vyaktim--personality; apannam--achieved;\nmanyante--think; mam--unto Me; abuddhayah--less intelligent persons;param--supreme; bhavam--state of being; ajanantah--without knowing;mama--My; avyayam--imperishable; anuttamam--the finest.\nTRANSLATIONUnintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form\nand personality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know Myhigher nature, which is changeless and supreme.\nPURPORTThose who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less\nintelligent persons, and here the impersonalists are similarlydescribed. Lord Krsna in His personal form is here speaking beforeArjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that theSupreme Lord ultimately has no form. Yamunacarya, a great devotee ofthe Lord in the disciplic succession from Ramanujacarya, has writtentwo very appropriate verses in this connection. He says,\"My dear Lord, devotees like Vyasadeva and Narada know You to be thePersonality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures,one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Youractivities, and one can thus understand that You are the SupremePersonality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion andignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They areunable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be indiscussing Vedanta and the Upanisads and other Vedic literatures, it isnot possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.\"(Stotra-ratna 12)In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the Personality of Godheadcannot be understood simply by study of the Vedanta literature. Only bythe mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme beknown. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only arethe worshipers of the demigods less intelligent, but those nondevoteeswho are engaged in Vedanta and speculation on Vedic literature withoutany tinge of true Krsna consciousness are also less intelligent, andfor them it is not possible to understand God's personal nature.Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth isimpersonal are described as abuddhayah, which means one who does notknow the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from theimpersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul--but theultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead.Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not evenfollow their great predecessor, Sankaracarya, who has specificallystated that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think Krsnato be only the son of Devaki and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerfulliving entity. This is also condemned in the Bhagavad-gita (9.11).\nAvajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam: \"Only the fools regard Me\nas an ordinary person.\"The fact is that no one can understand Krsna without renderingdevotional service and without developing Krsna consciousness. The Gitaconfirms this.One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, or Hisform, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussingVedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. Whenone is fully engaged in Krsna consciousness, beginning by chanting themaha-mantra--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama,Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare--then only can one understand theSupreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think thatKrsna has a body made of this material nature and that all Hisactivities, His form and everything, are maya. These impersonalists areknown as Mayavadis. They do not know the ultimate truth.The twentieth verse clearly states, kamais tais tair hrta-jnanahprapadyante 'nya-devatah. \"Those who are blinded by lusty desiressurrender unto the different demigods.\" It is accepted that besides theSupreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have theirdifferent planets, and the Lord also has a planet. As stated in thetwenty-third verse, devan deva-yajo yanti mad-bhakta yanti mam api: theworshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods,and those who are devotees of Lord Krsna go to the Krsnaloka planet.Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists stillmaintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms areimpositions. From the study of the Gita does it appear that thedemigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigodsnor Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They areall persons; Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Hehas His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless andthat form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here thatit is not imposed. From the Gita we can clearly understand that theforms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord aresimultaneously existing and that Lord Krsna is sac-cid-ananda, eternalblissful knowledge. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme AbsoluteTruth is ananda-mayo, or by nature full of blissful pleasure, and thatHe is abhyasat, by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspiciousqualities. And in the Gita the Lord says that although He is aja(unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we shouldunderstand from the Bhagavad-gita. We cannot understand how the SupremePersonality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of theimpersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the Gita areconcerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, LordKrsna, has both form and personality.\nTEXT 25\nnaham prakasah sarvasya\nyoga-maya-samavrtahmudho 'yam nabhijanatiloko mam ajam avyayam\nSYNONYMSna--nor; aham--I; prakasah--manifest; sarvasya--to everyone; yoga-maya-\n-internal potency; samavrtah--covered; mudhah--foolish; ayam--this; na-\n-not; abhijanati--can understand; lokah--such less intelligent persons;\nmam--Me; ajam--unborn; avyayam--inexhaustible.\nTRANSLATIONI am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am\ncovered by My eternal creative potency [yoga-maya]; and so the deludedworld knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible.\nPURPORTIt may be argued that since Krsna was present on this earth and was\nvisible to everyone, then why isn't He manifest to everyone now? Butactually He was not manifest to everyone. When Krsna was present therewere only a few people who could understand Him to be the SupremePersonality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when Sisupala spokeagainst Krsna being elected president of the assembly, Bhisma supportedHim and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the Pandavasand a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He wasnot revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore in theGita Krsna says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him tobe like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as thereservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees,He was covered by His internal potency.In the prayers of Kunti in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.8.19) it is saidthat the Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-maya and thus ordinarypeople cannot understand Him. This yoga-maya curtain is also confirmedin the Isopanisad (mantra 15), in which the devotee prays:\"O my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, anddevotional service to You is the highest religious principle.Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendentalform is covered by the yoga-maya. The brahmajyoti is the covering ofthe internal potency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgencethat impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, Your eternal formof bliss and knowledge.\"This yoga-maya curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter ofthe Gita. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental formof bliss and knowledge is covered by the internal potency of thebrahmajyoti, and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see theSupreme on this account. Also in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.7) thereis this prayer by Brahma: \"O Supreme Personality of Godhead, OSupersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency andpastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your internal potency,and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learnedscholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world oreven the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energyand potency, although You are present before them.\" The SupremePersonality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, is not only unborn but also avyaya,inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and Hisenergies are all inexhaustible.\nTEXT 26\nvedaham samatitani\nvartamanani carjunabhavisyani ca bhutanimam tu veda na kascana\nSYNONYMS\nveda--know; aham--I; sama--equally; a titani--past; vartamanani--\npresent; ca--and; arjuna--O Arjuna; bhavisyani--future; ca--also;bhutani--living entities; mam--Me; tu--but; veda--knows; na--not;kascana--anyone.\nTRANSLATIONO Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that\nhas happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and allthings that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me noone knows.\nPURPORTHere the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated.\nIf Krsna, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is consideredby the impersonalists to be maya, to be material, then He would, likethe living entity, change His body and forget everything in His pastlife. Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, norcan he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of hispresent life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past,present and future. Unless one is liberated from materialcontamination, he cannot know past, present and future.Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord Krsna clearly says that Hecompletely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in thepresent, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter wehave seen that Lord Krsna remembers instructing Vivasvan, the sun-god,millions of years ago. Krsna knows every living entity because He issituated in every living being's heart as the Supreme Soul. But despiteHis presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presencebeyond the material sky, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, theless intelligent cannot realize Him as the Supreme Person. Certainlythe transcendental body of Sri Krsna is not perishable. He is just likethe sun, and maya is like the cloud. In the material world we can seethat there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars andplanets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, butthis covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon andstars are not actually covered. Similarly, maya cannot cover theSupreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the lessintelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of thischapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to becomeperfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousandsof such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord Krsna is.Even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal Brahman orlocalized Paramatma, he cannot possibly understand the SupremePersonality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, without being in Krsnaconsciousness.\nTEXT 27\niccha-dvesa-samutthena\ndvandva-mohena bharatasarva-bhutani sammohamsarge yanti parantapa\nSYNONYMS\niccha--desire; dvesa--hate; samutthena--born; dvandva--duality; mohena-\n-overcome; bharata--O scion of Bharata; sarva--all; bhutani--livingentities; sammoham--into delusion; sarge--in creation; yanti--go;parantapa--O conqueror of enemies.\nTRANSLATIONO scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living\nentities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desireand hate.\nPURPORTThe real constitutional position of the living entity is that of\nsubordination to the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one isdeluded into separation from this pure knowledge, he becomes controlledby illusory energy and cannot understand the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. The illusory energy is manifested in the duality of desire andhate. Due to desire and hate, the ignorant person wants to become onewith the Supreme Lord and envies Krsna as the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. Pure devotees, who are not so deluded or contaminated bydesire and hate, can understand that Lord Sri Krsna appears by Hisinternal potencies, but those who are deluded by duality and nesciencethink that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is created by materialenergies. This is their misfortune. Such deluded persons,symptomatically, dwell in dualities of dishonor and honor, misery andhappiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure and pain, etc.,thinking, \"This is my wife; this is my house; I am the master of thishouse; I am the husband of this wife.\" These are the dualities ofdelusion. Those who are so deluded by dualities are completely foolishand therefore cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nTEXT 28\nyesam tv anta-gatam papam\njananam punya-karmanamte dvandva-moha-nirmuktabhajante mam drdha-vratah\nSYNONYMSyesam--whose; tu--but; anta-gatam--completely eradicated; papam--sin;\njananam--of the persons; punya--pious; karmanam--previous activities;te--they; dvandva--duality; moha--delusion; nirmuktah--free from;bhajante--worship; mam--Me; drdha-vratah--with determination.\nTRANSLATIONPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life,\nwhose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed fromthe duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service withdetermination.\nPURPORTThose eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are\nmentioned in this verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish\nand deceitful, it is very difficult to transcend the duality of desire\nand hate. Only those who have passed their lives in practicing theregulative principles of religion, who have acted piously and who haveconquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service and graduallyrise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then,gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality ofGodhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritualplatform. This elevation is possible in Krsna consciousness in theassociation of pure devotees who can deliver one from delusion.It is stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.2) that if one actuallywants to be liberated he must render service to the devotees (mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh); but one who associates with materialisticpeople is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence (tamo-dvaram yositam sangi-sangam). All the devotees of the Lord traversethis earth just to recover the conditioned souls from their delusion.The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their constitutionalposition as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest violationof God's law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutionalposition, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality orto be fully engaged in His transcendental loving service withdetermination.\nTEXT 29\njara-marana-moksaya\nmam asritya yatanti yete brahma tad viduh krtsnamadhyatmam karma cakhilam\nSYNONYMSjara--old age; marana--death; moksaya--for the purpose of liberation;\nmam--unto Me; asritya--taking shelter of; yatanti--endeavor; ye--allthose; te--such persons; brahma--Brahman; tat--actually that; viduh--they know; krtsnam--everything; adhyatmam--transcendental; karma--fruitive activities; ca--and; akhilam--entirely.\nTRANSLATIONIntelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and\ndeath take refuge in Me in devotional service. They are actuallyBrahman because they entirely know everything about transcendental andfruitive activities.\nPURPORTBirth, death, old age and diseases affect this material body, but not\nthe spiritual body. There is no birth, death, old age and disease forthe spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one ofthe associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages ineternal devotional service, is really liberated. Aham brahmasmi: I amspirit. It is said that one should understand that he is Brahman--spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is also in devotionalservice, as described in this verse. The pure devotees aretranscendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they knoweverything about transcendental and material activities.\nFour kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the\ntranscendental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, andby the grace of the Supreme Lord, when they are fully Krsna conscious,they actually enjoy spiritual association with the Supreme Lord. Butthose who are worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord inHis supreme planet. Even the less intelligent Brahman-realized personscannot reach the supreme planet of Krsna known as Goloka Vrndavana.Only persons who perform activities in Krsna consciousness (mamasritya) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they areactually endeavoring to reach the Krsna planet. Such persons have nomisgivings about Krsna, and thus they are factually Brahman.Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or arca of the Lord, orwho are engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation frommaterial bondage, also know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports ofBrahman, adhibhuta, etc., as explained by the Lord in the next chapter.\nTEXT 30\nsadhibhutadhidaivam mam\nsadhiyajnam ca ye viduhprayana-kale 'pi ca mamte vidur yukta-cetasah\nSYNONYMSsa-adhibhuta--the governing principle of the material manifestation;\nadhidaivam--underlying all the demigods; mam--Me; sa-adhiyajnam--sustaining all sacrifices; ca--and; ye--those; viduh--know; prayana--ofdeath; kale--at the time; api--even; ca--and; mam--Me; te--they; viduh--know; yukta-cetasah--with steadfast minds.\nTRANSLATIONThose who know Me as the Supreme Lord, as the governing principle of\nthe material manifestation, who know Me as the one underlying all thedemigods and as the one sustaining all sacrifices, can, with steadfastmind, understand and know Me, even at the time of death.\nPURPORTPersons acting in Krsna consciousness are never entirely deviated from\nthe path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In thetranscendental association of Krsna consciousness, one can understandhow the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the materialmanifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by suchtranscendental association, one becomes convinced of the SupremePersonality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a Krsnaconscious person can never forget Krsna. Naturally he is thus promotedto the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Vrndavana.This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fullyKrsna conscious person. The beginning of Krsna consciousness isassociation of persons who are in Krsna consciousness. Such associationis spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and,by His grace, one can understand Krsna to be the Supreme God. At thesame time one can really understand the constitutional position of theliving entity and how the living entity forgets Krsna and becomesentangled in material activities. By gradual development of Krsnaconsciousness in good association, the living entity can understand\nthat due to forgetfulness of Krsna he has become conditioned by the\nlaws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form oflife is an opportunity to regain Krsna consciousness and that it shouldbe fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress,the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledgeof Brahman, knowledge of Paramatma, liberation from birth, death anddiseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actuallyelevated in Krsna consciousness does not care for the differentprocesses. He simply directly engages himself in activities of Krsnaconsciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional positionas an eternal servitor of Lord Krsna. In such a situation he takespleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotionalservice. He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will befulfilled. This determined faith is called drdha-vrata, and that is thebeginning of bhakti-yoga or transcendental loving service. That is theverdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the Gita is thesubstance of that conviction.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the\nSrimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute."
